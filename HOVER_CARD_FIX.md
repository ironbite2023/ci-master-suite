# 🔧 HoverCard Dependency Fix

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## 🐛 **Issue**

Build error when trying to use the HoverCard component:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-hover-card'
```

**Root Cause:** The `@radix-ui/react-hover-card` package was not listed in `package.json` dependencies, even though the `hover-card.tsx` UI component wrapper file existed.

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **1. Added Package to package.json**
Manually added the missing dependency:

```json
"@radix-ui/react-hover-card": "^1.1.2"
```

**Location:** Between `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` and `@radix-ui/react-icons` (alphabetical order)

### **2. Ran npm install**
```bash
npm install
```

This installed the package and updated `package-lock.json`.

---

## 🎯 **Why This Approach?**

Looking at other Radix UI components in the project showed the pattern:
- All Radix UI packages are listed in `package.json` with specific versions
- The UI wrapper components (in `src/components/ui/`) are created manually
- The `hover-card.tsx` wrapper already existed, just needed the package installed

**Other Radix UI packages in the project:**
- `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog`
- `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`
- `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- `@radix-ui/react-label`
- `@radix-ui/react-progress`
- `@radix-ui/react-select`
- `@radix-ui/react-separator`
- `@radix-ui/react-slot`
- `@radix-ui/react-switch`
- `@radix-ui/react-tabs`

---

## 📁 **Files Changed**

### **Modified:**
- `package.json` - Added `@radix-ui/react-hover-card` dependency

### **Already Correct:**
- `src/components/ui/hover-card.tsx` - Wrapper component already existed ✅
- `src/components/games/catapult/VariationIndicator.tsx` - Imports already correct ✅

---

## ✅ **Verification**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Result: ✅ Clean (0 errors)
```

**Build status:** ✅ All systems operational

## 🎓 **HoverCard Usage in VariationIndicator**

The HoverCard provides an educational tooltip when users hover over the info icon (ℹ️) in the Variation section:

**Content shown:**
- What is process variation
- Sources of variation (Material, Environment, Equipment, Operator)
- Typical variation ranges for each source
- User's current process variation (±2%)
- Six Sigma context (±3σ target)

**UX Benefits:**
- Non-intrusive (only shows on hover)
- Rich educational content
- Better than simple HTML title attribute
- Consistent with other UI components

---

## 🚀 **Status**

✅ **Dependency installed**  
✅ **Build passing**  
✅ **HoverCard functional**  
✅ **Ready for testing**
