export const LEAN_VALUE_STREAM_FIRST: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-vsm-first',
  practice: 'Start with Value Stream Mapping before implementing changes',
  rationale: 'VSM reveals the full picture of waste and helps prioritize improvements with the biggest impact.'
}

export const LEAN_INVOLVE_OPERATORS: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-operators',
  practice: 'Involve operators in improvement activities',
  rationale: 'Those doing the work have the best ideas for improvement and will support changes they helped design.'
}

export const LEAN_SMALL_RAPID_TESTS: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-rapid-tests',
  practice: 'Use small, rapid experiments instead of large projects',
  rationale: 'Quick PDCA cycles allow faster learning and adaptation with less risk and investment.'
}

export const LEAN_VISUAL_MANAGEMENT: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-visual',
  practice: 'Make abnormalities immediately visible',
  rationale: 'Visual controls enable quick response to problems and prevent small issues from becoming big ones.'
}

export const LEAN_TAKT_TIME_ALIGNMENT: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-takt',
  practice: 'Design processes to match takt time (customer demand rate)',
  rationale: 'Synchronizing with customer demand eliminates overproduction and minimizes inventory.'
}

export const LEAN_FIVE_S_FOUNDATION: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-five-s',
  practice: 'Use 5S as the foundation for all Lean improvements',
  rationale: 'An organized, clean workplace is safer, more efficient, and reveals problems that were hidden by clutter.'
}

export const LEAN_STANDARD_WORK_DOCUMENT: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-standard-work',
  practice: 'Document standard work with time, sequence, and inventory',
  rationale: 'Clear standards enable training, problem detection, and serve as the baseline for kaizen.'
}

export const LEAN_MISTAKE_PROOFING: BestPractice = {
  id: 'bp-lean-poka-yoke',
  practice: 'Build quality in with mistake-proofing (poka-yoke)',
  rationale: 'Prevention devices eliminate defects at the source, reducing inspection and rework costs.'

export const LEAN_IMPLEMENTING_TOOLS_ONLY: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-tools-only',
  mistake: 'Implementing Lean tools without changing the culture',
  whyItsWrong: 'Tools without the thinking behind them become superficial activities that don\'t deliver results.',
  correction: 'Focus on developing problem-solving capability and respect for people alongside tools.'
}

export const LEAN_IGNORING_PEOPLE_SIDE: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-people',
  mistake: 'Ignoring the people side of change',
  whyItsWrong: 'Resistance and lack of understanding sabotage even the best technical solutions.',
  correction: 'Communicate the why, involve people in design, provide training, and celebrate small wins.'
}

export const LEAN_COPYING_TOYOTA: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-copying',
  mistake: 'Trying to copy Toyota exactly without adapting to your context',
  whyItsWrong: 'What works in automotive manufacturing may not work in your industry or culture.',
  correction: 'Learn the principles, then adapt the tools to fit your specific situation and challenges.'
}

export const LEAN_BIG_BANG_IMPLEMENTATION: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-big-bang',
  mistake: 'Attempting a "big bang" Lean transformation',
  whyItsWrong: 'Large-scale changes overwhelm the organization and often fail to stick.',
  correction: 'Start small with a model line or area. Learn, refine, then expand gradually.'
}

export const LEAN_METRICS_ONLY: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-metrics',
  mistake: 'Focusing only on metrics without understanding the process',
  whyItsWrong: 'Gaming the numbers becomes more important than actually improving.',
  correction: 'Use metrics as indicators, but go to gemba to understand what the numbers really mean.'
}

export const LEAN_ELIMINATING_SLACK: CommonMistake = {
  id: 'cm-lean-no-slack',
  mistake: 'Eliminating all slack and buffer in the system',
  whyItsWrong: 'Zero buffer makes the system fragile. Any variation causes shutdowns.',
  correction: 'Maintain strategic buffers where variation is high. Reduce buffer as you reduce variation.'
