## 📝 **Notes for Check Agent**

### **Testing Recommendations:**
1. Complete DOE mode first to establish optimal distance
2. Enter Validation mode to see banner
3. Launch several shots to see variation indicator
4. Check statistics summary appears after 5 shots
5. Click "Learn More" to verify modal content
6. Dismiss banner and verify persistence
7. Switch between modes to verify mode-specific colors

### **Expected Behavior:**
- Banner only in Validation, Capability, Control modes
- Indicator color changes based on deviation level
- Statistics summary accurate and updates in real-time
- Optimal distance from DOE analysis provides consistent target
- Modal provides comprehensive educational content

### **Known Limitations:**
- Banner cannot be re-shown after dismissal (design choice)
- Statistics summary requires minimum 5 shots (statistical validity)
- Optimal distance defaults to 100m if DOE not completed (fallback)

### **No Issues Found:**
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ✅ No runtime errors expected
- ✅ All props properly typed
- ✅ State management tested
- ✅ Integration points verified
