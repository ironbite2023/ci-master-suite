## 🎯 Purpose

This folder organizes documentation by **feature** rather than by document type, making it easier to:
- Find all documentation related to a specific feature
- Onboard new developers to a particular feature area
- Track feature-specific implementation progress
- Maintain feature documentation as the project scales

## 📝 Adding New Features

When adding a new feature to CI Master Suite:
1. Create a new subfolder under `4-features/`
2. Add a README.md explaining the feature
3. Include implementation plans, progress docs, and user guides
4. Keep all feature-related documentation together
