## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Key Functions Added:**

```typescript
// Initialize experiments when entering DOE mode
useEffect(() => {
  if (gameMode === 'doe' && doeExperiments.length === 0) {
    const experiments = generateDOEExperiments()
    setDoeExperiments(experiments)
    // Load first experiment settings
  }
}, [gameMode])

// Save experiment result after landing
if (gameMode === 'doe') {
  const currentExperiment = findExperimentBySettings(doeExperiments, settings)
  if (currentExperiment && !currentExperiment.completed) {
    const result = { distance, accuracy, score, timestamp }
    const updated = saveExperimentResult(doeExperiments, runNumber, result)
    setDoeExperiments(updated)
    
    // Auto-load next experiment
    setTimeout(() => {
      const nextExp = getNextIncompleteExperiment(updated)
      if (nextExp) setSettings(loadExperimentSettings(nextExp))
    }, 2000)
  }
}

// Persist to localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  if (doeExperiments.length > 0) {
    localStorage.setItem('catapult-doe-experiments', JSON.stringify(doeExperiments))
  }
}, [doeExperiments])

// Auto-show analysis when complete
useEffect(() => {
  if (gameMode === 'doe' && isExperimentSetComplete(doeExperiments)) {
    setShowAnalysis(true)
  }
}, [doeExperiments, gameMode])
```
