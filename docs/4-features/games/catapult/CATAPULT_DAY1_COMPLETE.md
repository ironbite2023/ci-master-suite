## 🎓 **EDUCATIONAL FEATURES**

### **Teaching DOE Concepts:**
1. **Parameters**: 3 controllable factors (angle, force, weight)
2. **Response Variables**: Distance, accuracy, score
3. **Experimentation**: Try different combinations
4. **Data Collection**: Shot history tracked
5. **Performance Analysis**: Statistics calculated

### **Next: DOE Integration (Day 3)**
- Factorial design matrix (2³ = 8 experiments)
- Main effects calculation
- Interaction plots
- Statistical analysis
- Optimal settings recommendation

---

## 🚀 **ROUTE ACCESS**

Play the game at: `/games/play/catapult`

```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/games/play/catapult
```

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES**

**None!** ✅

All core functionality working as expected. Minor ESLint warnings in old files (not related to Catapult game).

---

## 📈 **NEXT STEPS (Day 2)**
