# TASK: PDCA Cycle Migration

**Tool**: PDCA Cycle Manager  
**Priority**: 1 (Critical - Core CI Tool)  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Status**: üîú READY TO START  
**Assigned**: Not assigned

---

## üìã TASK OVERVIEW

### What We're Doing
Migrate the PDCA Cycle Manager from a custom 700+ line implementation to a clean, config-driven Guided Wizard integration following the proven pattern established with 5 Why, Fishbone, and A3 tools.

### Why This Tool
PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is the **fundamental continuous improvement cycle** used across all Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. It's the backbone of systematic problem-solving and process improvement. Making this tool guided and educational will help users learn proper PDCA methodology while using it.

### Business Value
- **Core Methodology**: PDCA is used in 80%+ of CI projects
- **Training Tool**: Teaches proper iterative improvement
- **Standardization**: Ensures consistent PDCA execution across organization
- **Documentation**: Captures improvement cycles for organizational learning

## üìñ PDCA METHODOLOGY REFERENCE

### The 4 Phases
1. **PLAN**: Identify problem, analyze root causes, develop countermeasures
2. **DO**: Implement countermeasures on small scale (pilot)
3. **CHECK**: Measure results, compare to targets, evaluate effectiveness
4. **ACT**: Standardize successful changes, adjust and repeat cycle

### Key Principles
- **Iterative**: PDCA is a cycle, not a one-time event
- **Data-Driven**: Decisions based on data, not opinions
- **Small Steps**: Start small, learn, then scale
- **Standardization**: Successful changes become standard work

## üö® POTENTIAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Existing Data Structure
**Problem**: Current implementation may use different data structure  
**Solution**: Map existing fields to new questions, preserve data compatibility

### Issue 2: Too Many Questions
**Problem**: 18+ questions might overwhelm users  
**Solution**: Mark some as optional, use conditional logic, group related questions

### Issue 3: Validation Too Strict
**Problem**: Users can't proceed due to validation  
**Solution**: Balance required vs. optional, provide clear error messages

### Issue 4: Guidance Overload
**Problem**: Too much guidance might be overwhelming  
**Solution**: Prioritize high/medium priority tips, limit to 3-5 per step
