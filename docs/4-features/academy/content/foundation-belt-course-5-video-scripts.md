**[00:00 - 00:45] HOOK & INTRODUCTION**

Quick question: Can you draw your job?

Not your office or your desk—I mean the actual work you do, step by step, from start to finish?

[VISUAL: Person attempting to sketch their work process, looking confused]

Most people struggle with this. We do our work every day, but we've never visualized the entire process.

That's a problem because:
- If you can't see the process, you can't improve it
- If everyone has a different mental model, you can't align on solutions
- If the process isn't documented, new people learn by trial and error

Process mapping solves this. It makes invisible work visible.

Today, you're learning how to create process maps—visual diagrams that show exactly how work flows from start to finish. This simple skill is a game-changer for continuous improvement.

**[00:45 - 02:15] WHAT IS PROCESS MAPPING?**

A process map (also called flowchart) is a visual diagram showing the sequence of steps in a process.

[VISUAL: Simple process map example appearing]

**Why process mapping matters:**

**1. CREATES SHARED UNDERSTANDING**
- Everyone sees the process the same way
- No more "I thought you did that!" confusion
- Common language for improvement discussions

**2. REVEALS PROBLEMS**
- Redundant steps become obvious
- Handoffs and delays visible
- Complexity you didn't realize existed

**3. DOCUMENTS KNOWLEDGE**
- Captures tribal knowledge before people leave
- Training tool for new employees
- Standard reference for "how we do things"

**4. ENABLES IMPROVEMENT**
- Can't improve what you can't see
- Before/after maps prove improvement
- Identifies specific improvement opportunities

[EXAMPLE]

A company mapped their customer onboarding process. They discovered:
- 23 steps (they thought it was 12)
- 5 handoffs between departments (communication gaps)
- 8 approval steps (6 were redundant)
- Average 14 days, but only 3 hours of actual work!

The map revealed problems they didn't know existed. Just drawing the map sparked improvement ideas!

**[02:15 - 05:00] BASIC FLOWCHART SYMBOLS**

Process maps use standardized symbols. Learn these five, and you can map 90% of processes!

[VISUAL: Flowchart symbols appearing one by one]

**1. OVAL (START/END)**

Shows where process begins and ends.

[VISUAL: Oval with "Start" and "End" labels]

**Usage:**
- One start per process (entry point)
- One or more ends (exit points, including error exits)
- Labels: "Start," "End," "Process Complete"

**2. RECTANGLE (PROCESS STEP/ACTIVITY)**

Represents an action, task, or activity.

[VISUAL: Rectangle with example text]

**Usage:**
- Use action verbs: "Review document," "Send email," "Assemble parts"
- Be specific but concise
- One action per box (keep it simple)

**Examples:**
- "Receive customer order"
- "Check inventory availability"
- "Pack items into box"

**3. DIAMOND (DECISION/QUESTION)**

Represents a yes/no question or decision point.

[VISUAL: Diamond with question and two paths]

**Usage:**
- Always phrased as yes/no question
- Two exits: "Yes" and "No" (or "True/False," "Pass/Fail")
- Creates branches in process

**Examples:**
- "Item in stock?"
- "Order > $500?"
- "Approved?"

**4. ARROW (FLOW LINE)**

Shows direction of flow from one step to the next.

[VISUAL: Arrows connecting shapes]

**Usage:**
- Arrows always have direction (show with arrowhead)
- Flow typically top-to-bottom or left-to-right
- Can cross, but minimize for clarity

**5. PARALLELOGRAM (INPUT/OUTPUT)** (Optional but useful)

Represents data or materials entering or leaving process.

[VISUAL: Parallelogram examples]

**Usage:**
- "Customer provides order form" (input)
- "System generates invoice" (output)

**NOTE:** Some processes work fine with just rectangles, diamonds, and arrows. Use what makes your map clear!

[VISUAL: Complete simple flowchart using all symbols]

**Example - Simple process:**
- Start (oval)
- Receive order (rectangle)
- Check inventory (rectangle)
- In stock? (diamond)
  - Yes → Pack order (rectangle) → Ship (rectangle) → End (oval)
  - No → Notify customer (rectangle) → End (oval)

**[05:00 - 07:30] CREATING YOUR FIRST PROCESS MAP**

Let's walk through creating a process map step-by-step.

**STEP 1: DEFINE SCOPE**

Answer these questions:
- **What process?** Be specific (not "sales process"—too broad. "Quote-to-order process"—specific)
- **Start point?** Where does process begin? (Customer requests quote)
- **End point?** Where does process end? (Order placed in system)
- **Boundaries?** What's included/excluded?

**STEP 2: IDENTIFY STEPS (BRAINSTORM)**

List all steps without organizing yet:
- Walk through process mentally
- Better: observe process happening (Gemba!)
- Even better: have people who do the work list steps

Use sticky notes—one step per note (easy to rearrange!)

**STEP 3: SEQUENCE STEPS**

Arrange steps in order:
- What happens first? Second? Third?
- Look for decision points (yes/no questions)
- Identify parallel activities (happen simultaneously)
- Note loops (process circles back)

**STEP 4: DRAW THE MAP**

Use symbols:
- Rectangles for steps
- Diamonds for decisions
- Arrows for flow
- Keep it neat and readable!

**Tools:** Paper, whiteboard, PowerPoint, Visio, free tools (Lucidchart, draw.io)

**STEP 5: VALIDATE**

Show map to people who do the work:
- "Does this match reality?"
- "What's missing?"
- "What's wrong?"

**Critical:** Map should show actual process (as-is), not ideal process (should-be)!

[EXAMPLE - Order Processing]

**Steps identified:**
1. Receive customer order
2. Enter order in system
3. Check customer credit
4. Check inventory
5. Allocate inventory
6. Generate pick list
7. Pick items from warehouse
8. Pack items
9. Generate shipping label
10. Ship order

**Decision points:**
- Credit approved? (If no → contact customer)
- All items in stock? (If no → backorder or partial ship?)

[VISUAL: Flowchart of order processing with these steps]

**[07:30 - 09:30] SWIMLANE DIAGRAMS (NEXT LEVEL)**

When processes cross departments or roles, use **swimlane diagrams** (also called cross-functional flowcharts).

[VISUAL: Swimlane diagram template]

**What's different:**

Process map is divided into horizontal "lanes"—one lane per department/role.

**Why swimlanes matter:**

- Shows who does what (accountability clear)
- Reveals handoffs between departments (where delays/errors occur)
- Identifies duplication (multiple departments doing same thing)

**Creating swimlanes:**

[VISUAL: Building a swimlane diagram step-by-step]

**STEP 1: Identify actors** (departments, roles, systems)
- Customer
- Sales
- Credit Department
- Warehouse
- Shipping

**STEP 2: Create lanes** (horizontal rows, one per actor)

**STEP 3: Map process**, placing each step in appropriate lane

**STEP 4: Show handoffs** (arrows crossing lane boundaries)

[EXAMPLE - Order Processing Swimlane]

**Customer lane:**
- Submits order

**Sales lane:**
- Receives order → Enters in system → Requests credit check

**Credit Department lane:**
- Reviews credit → Approves/denies → Notifies Sales

**Warehouse lane:**
- Receives pick list → Picks items → Packs → Sends to Shipping

**Shipping lane:**
- Creates label → Ships order → Notifies customer

[VISUAL: Complete swimlane diagram]

**Insights from swimlane:**
- 4 handoffs (potential communication delays!)
- Customer waits during credit check (nothing happening from their perspective)
- Warehouse can't start until credit approved (bottleneck!)

Swimlanes make these insights obvious!

**[09:30 - 10:30] PROCESS MAPPING BEST PRACTICES**

**DO's:**

✓ **Keep it simple:** Don't map every tiny detail initially. Start high-level (5-10 steps), then drill down if needed.

✓ **Map reality, not theory:** Show what actually happens, not what policy says should happen.

✓ **Involve the people who do the work:** They know the truth! Don't map in isolation.

✓ **Use consistent symbols:** Stick to standard flowchart conventions.

✓ **Label clearly:** Each step should be clear and actionable verb.

✓ **Show decision criteria:** Not just "Approved?" but "Approved? (>$1000 requires manager approval)"

**DON'Ts:**

❌ **Don't map to blame:** Process mapping reveals problems, not people problems. Focus on systems.

❌ **Don't make it too complex:** If your map doesn't fit on one page, you're mapping too much detail. Break into sub-processes.

❌ **Don't skip validation:** Always verify map with process users!

❌ **Don't confuse current with future state:** Map what is, then design what should be (separate maps!).

**[10:30 - 10:45] FROM MAP TO IMPROVEMENT**

Once you have a process map, what next?

**ANALYZE FOR WASTE:**

[VISUAL: Process map with waste highlighted]

Look for:
- **Waiting:** Delays between steps
- **Rework loops:** Process circles back to fix errors
- **Redundancy:** Same step done multiple times or by multiple people
- **Handoffs:** Every handoff = potential for delay/error
- **Decision points:** Too many approvals?
- **Complexity:** Unnecessarily complicated routing

**IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS:**

For each step, ask:
- **Eliminate:** Can we remove this step entirely?
- **Simplify:** Can we make this easier/faster?
- **Automate:** Can technology do this?
- **Combine:** Can we merge steps?
- **Reorder:** Should sequence change?
- **Parallelize:** Can steps happen simultaneously?

[EXAMPLE]

**Current state:** 3 sequential approval steps (Manager → Director → VP) = 3 days

**Improvement:** Parallel approvals (all three review simultaneously) = 1 day

Simple change, massive impact!

**[10:45 - 11:00] WRAP-UP & ASSIGNMENT**

Let's recap process mapping:

[VISUAL: Summary slide]

✓ **Purpose:** Make processes visible for analysis and improvement  
✓ **Basic symbols:** Oval (start/end), Rectangle (step), Diamond (decision), Arrow (flow)  
✓ **Steps:** Define scope, identify steps, sequence, draw, validate  
✓ **Swimlanes:** Show cross-functional processes with roles/handoffs  
✓ **Analysis:** Look for waste, ask improvement questions  
✓ **Result:** Shared understanding + improvement opportunities identified

**Your assignment:**

**Create a process map:**

1. Choose a simple process you do regularly (5-10 steps)
2. List all steps
3. Identify decision points
4. Draw flowchart using proper symbols
5. Validate with someone else familiar with process
6. Analyze: Identify 2-3 improvement opportunities
7. Bonus: Create swimlane version if process crosses roles/departments

**Keep it simple—practice the technique!**

In Module 5.2, we'll explore various problem-solving frameworks that use process maps and other tools to drive structured improvement.

## Module 5.2: Problem-Solving Tools & Frameworks

**Duration:** 11 minutes | **Word Count:** ~1,390 words

### Script

[VISUAL: Title slide - "Problem-Solving Tools & Frameworks" with CI Master Academy logo]

**[00:00 - 00:45] HOOK & INTRODUCTION**

Ever noticed that when faced with a problem, different people approach it completely differently?

Some people jump straight to solutions. Others analyze endlessly. Some blame people. Others blame systems.

[VISUAL: Four different people approaching same problem differently]

The problem? Without a structured approach, problem-solving is inconsistent, inefficient, and often ineffective.

The solution? **Problem-solving frameworks**—structured methodologies that guide you from problem to sustainable solution.

Today, we're exploring multiple problem-solving frameworks. You've already learned DMAIC (Module 4). Now you'll learn A3, 8D, and PDCA—and know when to use each.

Think of these as tools in your problem-solving toolkit. Different problems require different tools!

**[00:45 - 02:30] WHY STRUCTURED PROBLEM-SOLVING MATTERS**

Before diving into specific frameworks, let's understand why structure matters.

[VISUAL: Structured vs Unstructured comparison]

**UNSTRUCTURED PROBLEM-SOLVING (Common approach):**

1. Problem happens
2. Jump to solution (first idea)
3. Implement quickly
4. Problem returns (because root cause not addressed)
5. Try another quick fix
6. Endless cycle of firefighting

**STRUCTURED PROBLEM-SOLVING:**

1. Define problem clearly
2. Analyze root causes with data
3. Develop and test solutions
4. Implement and monitor
5. Problem stays solved!

[ANIMATION: Cycle breaking with structured approach]

**Benefits of structured approach:**

✓ **Solves problems permanently** (not just symptoms)  
✓ **Uses data, not opinions** (objective decisions)  
✓ **Engages teams** (collaborative, not blame-focused)  
✓ **Builds capability** (teaches methodology, not just fixes problem)  
✓ **Documents learning** (others can learn from solutions)

**[02:30 - 04:30] A3 PROBLEM-SOLVING (TOYOTA METHOD)**

The A3 is Toyota's famous problem-solving methodology, named after the paper size used (A3 = 11"×17").

[VISUAL: A3 template appearing]

**What makes A3 special:**

- Entire problem-solving story fits on one page
- Visual (graphs, charts, sketches)
- Structured but flexible
- Develops critical thinking

**A3 STRUCTURE (8 sections):**

[VISUAL: A3 divided into 8 boxes]

**LEFT SIDE (UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM):**

**1. BACKGROUND**
- Why are we working on this?
- What's the context?
- Why does it matter?

**2. CURRENT CONDITION**
- What's happening now?
- Show with data, graphs, process maps
- Quantify the problem

**3. GOAL/TARGET**
- What does success look like?
- Specific, measurable target
- By when?

**4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
- What's causing the problem?
- Use 5 Whys, fishbone, data analysis
- Verify with data

**RIGHT SIDE (SOLVING THE PROBLEM):**

**5. COUNTERMEASURES** (Solutions)
- What actions will address root causes?
- Who, what, when
- Multiple countermeasures for each root cause

**6. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
- Detailed action plan
- Timeline with milestones
- Resources required

**7. FOLLOW-UP/CONFIRMATION**
- How will we verify success?
- What metrics to track?
- When to check?

**8. REFLECTION/LEARNING**
- What did we learn?
- What would we do differently?
- How to prevent similar problems?

[EXAMPLE - A3 for Customer Complaints]

**Background:** Customer complaints increased 40% in Q3  
**Current Condition:** 145 complaints/month (up from 104). Top issue: late deliveries (65% of complaints)  
**Goal:** Reduce complaints to <110/month by Q4  
**Root Cause:** Warehouse staffing inadequate during peak seasons (data shows delays coincide with volume spikes)  
**Countermeasures:** Add temporary staff during peak seasons, improve forecasting  
**Implementation:** Hire temps by Nov 1, train on new forecast model  
**Follow-up:** Track complaints weekly  
**Reflection:** Should have analyzed seasonal patterns earlier

**Why A3 works:**

- Forces systematic thinking (can't skip steps!)
- One-page format = clear, concise communication
- Visual = easy to understand
- Develops people (creating A3 builds problem-solving skills)

**When to use A3:**
- Medium complexity problems (too simple? Just fix it. Too complex? Use DMAIC)
- Cross-functional issues
- When you want to develop people's problem-solving capability
- 1-3 month projects

**[04:30 - 06:30] 8D PROBLEM-SOLVING (FORD METHOD)**

8D (Eight Disciplines) originated at Ford Motor Company for addressing customer complaints and systemic problems.

[VISUAL: 8D process flow]

**THE 8 DISCIPLINES:**

**D0: PREPARE** (Sometimes added as preliminary step)
- Gather initial information
- Assess if 8D is appropriate

**D1: BUILD THE TEAM**
- Assemble cross-functional team
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Get resources and management support

**Why start here?** Complex problems need diverse perspectives!

**D2: DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM**
- Use specific terms (who, what, where, when, how many)
- Quantify with data
- Show photos, samples, defect examples

**Tool:** "Is/Is Not" analysis (where problem IS happening and where it ISN'T)

**D3: IMPLEMENT INTERIM CONTAINMENT**
- Stop the bleeding immediately!
- Prevent problem from reaching more customers
- Temporary fix while root cause is investigated

**Example:** Recall defective batch, add inspection step, quarantine suspect inventory

**D4: IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSES**
- Use 5 Whys, fishbone, fault tree analysis
- Verify root causes with data
- Test hypotheses

**D5: DEVELOP PERMANENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS**
- Solutions that eliminate root causes
- Multiple solutions for each root cause
- Select best solutions

**D6: IMPLEMENT PERMANENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS**
- Execute solutions
- Remove interim containment (no longer needed)
- Validate problem is resolved

**D7: PREVENT RECURRENCE**
- Update systems, procedures, standards
- Training on new methods
- Share lessons learned across organization
- Update FMEA (if used)

**This is what separates 8D from other methods—emphasis on systematic prevention!**

**D8: RECOGNIZE THE TEAM**
- Celebrate success
- Recognize contributions
- Document lessons learned
- Close the problem formally

[EXAMPLE - 8D for Product Defect]

**D1:** Team formed (Quality, Engineering, Production, Supplier)  
**D2:** Problem: 3.2% of units failing final test (up from 0.8%)  
**D3:** Interim: 100% inspection on all units until resolved  
**D4:** Root cause: Supplier changed component material without notification  
**D5:** Corrective actions: Require supplier change approval, add incoming inspection  
**D6:** Implemented new approval process, trained inspectors  
**D7:** Updated supplier contracts, added clause requiring change notification  
**D8:** Team recognized at monthly meeting, documented case study

**When to use 8D:**
- Customer complaints or quality crises
- Supplier-related problems
- Systemic failures requiring systematic prevention
- When problem is urgent (interim containment buys time)
- Automotive, aerospace, manufacturing industries (common standard)

**[06:30 - 08:30] PDCA FOR RAPID IMPROVEMENT**

We introduced PDCA in Module 1.1, but let's dive deeper on using it for problem-solving.

[VISUAL: PDCA cycle detailed]

**PDCA = Plan - Do - Check - Act**

**PLAN:**
- Define problem or opportunity
- Analyze current situation
- Develop hypothesis for improvement
- Plan small-scale test

**DO:**
- Implement plan on small scale (pilot!)
- Collect data during test
- Document observations

**CHECK:**
- Analyze results
- Compare to predictions
- Did it work? Why or why not?
- Identify learnings

**ACT:**
- If successful: Standardize and implement broadly
- If unsuccessful: Adjust and try again (start new PDCA cycle)
- Document learning either way

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

**1. START SMALL**
- Test on one line, one team, one product
- Learn quickly with minimal risk
- Refine before scaling

**2. USE DATA**
- Measure before (baseline) and after (results)
- Objective evaluation, not opinions

**3. ITERATE QUICKLY**
- Complete cycle in days/weeks, not months
- Multiple fast cycles better than one slow cycle

**4. STANDARDIZE SUCCESS**
- Document what worked
- Train others
- Make it the new standard

[EXAMPLE - PDCA for Meeting Efficiency]

**Plan:** Hypothesis: Standing meetings with strict 15-min limit will improve efficiency. Test with weekly team meeting for 4 weeks.

**Do:** Conducted 4 standing meetings, 15-min time limit, agenda sent 24 hrs advance.

**Check:** Measured results:
- Average time: 17 minutes (vs 45 min previous)
- 85% of team say meetings more productive
- 100% of agenda items completed

**Act:** Success! Standardize for all recurring team meetings. Update meeting policy, train other teams.

**When to use PDCA:**
- Quick improvements (test in days/weeks)
- Low-risk experiments
- Continuous improvement culture (everyone can use it!)
- When solution is uncertain (hypothesis testing)
- Iterative improvements (refine over time)

**PDCA vs DMAIC:**

- **PDCA:** Fast, simple, anyone can use, good for straightforward problems
- **DMAIC:** Slower, more rigorous, requires training, good for complex problems

Both valuable—use appropriate tool for situation!

**[08:30 - 10:00] CHOOSING THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK**

With multiple frameworks, how do you choose?

[VISUAL: Decision matrix]

**SELECTION CRITERIA:**

**USE PDCA WHEN:**
- Problem is straightforward
- Solution hypothesis is clear
- Need quick iteration
- Low risk/low complexity
- Building continuous improvement culture
- **Example:** Improve office process efficiency

**USE A3 WHEN:**
- Medium complexity
- Cross-functional involvement needed
- Developing people's problem-solving skills
- 1-3 month timeline
- Need to communicate across organization
- **Example:** Reduce order processing time

**USE 8D WHEN:**
- Customer complaint or quality issue
- Systemic problem requiring prevention
- Need interim containment while solving
- Automotive/aerospace/manufacturing context
- 2-4 month timeline
- **Example:** Address product defect reaching customers

**USE DMAIC WHEN:**
- Complex, high-impact problem
- Significant data analysis required
- Need statistical rigor
- Major process capability issues
- 4-6 month timeline
- Six Sigma infrastructure exists
- **Example:** Reduce defect rate from 5% to 1%

[VISUAL: Comparison table of all four frameworks]

| Framework | Complexity | Timeline | Key Feature |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| PDCA | Low | Days-Weeks | Fast iteration |
| A3 | Medium | 1-3 months | One-page visual |
| 8D | Medium-High | 2-4 months | Customer focus |
| DMAIC | High | 4-6 months | Statistical rigor |

**Pro tip:** You can combine frameworks! Use PDCA within DMAIC's Improve phase. Use A3 to document a DMAIC project. Use 5 Whys within 8D's D4 step.

**[10:00 - 10:30] COMMON MISTAKES ACROSS ALL FRAMEWORKS**

Regardless of framework, avoid these mistakes:

**MISTAKE 1: Skipping Root Cause Analysis**
- Jumping to solutions without understanding causes
- Treats symptoms, not root causes
- Problem returns

**MISTAKE 2: No Data/Evidence**
- Opinions instead of facts
- Can't prove improvement
- Decisions based on hunches

**MISTAKE 3: Not Piloting Solutions**
- Implementing organization-wide without testing
- High risk if solution doesn't work
- Missed opportunity to refine

**MISTAKE 4: Declaring Victory Too Early**
- Celebrating before improvements sustained
- No follow-up monitoring
- Backsliding occurs

**MISTAKE 5: Not Documenting/Sharing Learning**
- Organization doesn't learn from project
- Same problems recur elsewhere
- Missed opportunity to build capability

**[10:30 - 10:45] BUILDING PROBLEM-SOLVING CAPABILITY**

Organizations with strong problem-solving culture:
- Train everyone in at least one framework (usually PDCA)
- Train leaders in multiple frameworks
- Provide coaching/mentorship
- Celebrate problem-solving, not just results
- Make problem-solving visible (boards, presentations)

**[10:45 - 11:00] WRAP-UP & ASSIGNMENT**

Let's recap problem-solving frameworks:

[VISUAL: Summary slide]

✓ **Structured approach** prevents firefighting, solves problems permanently  
✓ **A3:** One-page visual, develops people, medium complexity  
✓ **8D:** Customer-focused, interim containment, systematic prevention  
✓ **PDCA:** Fast iteration, hypothesis testing, everyone can use  
✓ **DMAIC:** Complex problems, statistical rigor, 4-6 months  
✓ **Choose framework** based on complexity, timeline, risk, resources

**Your assignment:**

1. Review a recent problem you solved (or tried to solve)
2. Which framework would have been most appropriate? Why?
3. Choose a current problem you're facing
4. Select appropriate framework
5. Complete first phase/step of that framework (Plan, Background, D1-D2, or Define)
6. Share with mentor or colleague for feedback

**Start building your problem-solving muscle!**

In Module 5.3, we'll dive deep into Root Cause Analysis techniques—the critical step in every problem-solving framework.

## Module 5.3: Root Cause Analysis Techniques

**Duration:** 11 minutes | **Word Count:** ~1,390 words

### Script

[VISUAL: Title slide - "Root Cause Analysis Techniques" with CI Master Academy logo]

**[00:00 - 00:45] HOOK & INTRODUCTION**

A chemical plant kept experiencing equipment failures. Their solution? Replace failed parts, restart, continue.

But failures kept happening—same equipment, similar failures, every few weeks.

Finally, an engineer asked: "Why do these failures keep happening?"

[VISUAL: Investigation montage]

Root cause analysis revealed: Cooling system inadequate during summer months. Heat stress caused component failures.

Solution: Upgrade cooling. Result: Failures dropped to nearly zero.

**Cost of treating symptoms:** $50K/year in replacement parts  
**Cost of fixing root cause:** $15K one-time investment  
**Savings:** $35K/year forever

**The lesson:** Treat root causes, not symptoms!

Today, we're exploring multiple Root Cause Analysis (RCA) techniques. You've seen some already (5 Whys, Fishbone). Now we'll go deeper and learn when to use each.

**[00:45 - 02:00] WHY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS MATTERS**

Let's start with a critical distinction:

[VISUAL: Tree analogy - symptoms are leaves, root cause is roots]

**SYMPTOMS:** Visible problems (the "what")
- Equipment fails
- Defects occur
- Customers complain
- Projects run late

**ROOT CAUSES:** Underlying reasons (the "why")
- Inadequate cooling system
- No quality checks in process
- Unclear requirements
- No project management methodology

**Treating symptoms:**
- Provides temporary relief
- Problem returns
- Endless firefighting
- Expensive (repeated fixes)

**Treating root causes:**
- Permanent solution
- Problem doesn't return
- Time invested upfront, savings forever
- Prevents future similar problems

[EXAMPLE - Analogy]

**Symptom:** Office floor is wet  
**Quick fix:** Mop the floor  
**Result:** Floor wet again tomorrow

**Root cause analysis:**
Why wet? Water leak.  
Why leak? Pipe cracked.  
Why cracked? Pipe old, corroded.

**Fix root cause:** Replace aging pipes  
**Result:** Floor stays dry!

**[02:00 - 04:30] THE 5 WHYS (DEEP DIVE)**

We've touched on 5 Whys before. Now let's master it.

[VISUAL: 5 Whys chain appearing]

**THE TECHNIQUE:**

Start with problem, ask "Why?" five times (approximately) until you reach root cause.

**DETAILED EXAMPLE:**

**Problem:** Customer shipments arriving late

**Why?** Warehouse processing orders slowly.

**Why?** Pickers taking longer to find items.

**Why?** Warehouse reorganized recently, pickers don't know new layout.

**Why?** No training provided after reorganization.

**Why?** No training process exists for layout changes.

**ROOT CAUSE:** No standard process for training after operational changes.

**Solution:** Create standard training protocol for operational changes.

**How do you know you've reached root cause?**

Ask: "If we fix this, will the problem stop recurring?"

If yes → You've reached root cause  
If no → Keep asking why

**COMMON 5 WHYS MISTAKES:**

**MISTAKE 1: Stopping too early**

Problem: Equipment breaks  
Why? Part failed  
**STOP HERE = SYMPTOM!**

Keep going:  
Why failed? Not maintained  
Why not maintained? No maintenance schedule  
**ROOT CAUSE = No preventive maintenance system**

**MISTAKE 2: Following wrong path**

Problem: Software bugs  
Why? Developers making mistakes  
Why? Developers not skilled  
**WRONG PATH! This blames people, not systems**

Better path:  
Why bugs? No code review process  
Why no code review? Process not established  
**ROOT CAUSE = Missing quality assurance process**

**MISTAKE 3: Asking "who" instead of "why"**

- "Why?" leads to system causes  
- "Who?" leads to blaming people

**Always focus on systems, not people!**

**ENHANCING 5 WHYS:**

Use data to verify each "why":
- Don't guess—measure!
- "Why is processing slow?" → Measure processing times, identify bottlenecks with data
- Makes 5 Whys more rigorous

**[04:30 - 07:00] FISHBONE DIAGRAM (ADVANCED)**

We introduced Fishbone (Ishikawa diagram) in Module 4.3. Let's go deeper.

[VISUAL: Detailed fishbone diagram]

**REVIEW: BASIC STRUCTURE**

- **Head:** Problem
- **Major bones:** Categories (6 M's)
- **Minor bones:** Causes within each category

**ADVANCED TECHNIQUE: DETAILED FISHBONE**

For each potential cause, ask "Why?" to identify sub-causes.

[EXAMPLE - Defects in Manufacturing]

**Major bone: MATERIALS**
- Raw material variability
  - Why? Multiple suppliers with different specs
  - Why? No standardized material specification
- Material contamination
  - Why? Improper storage conditions
  - Why? No environmental controls in storage area

**Major bone: METHODS**
- Process not standardized
  - Why? No written procedures
  - Why? Relied on tribal knowledge
- Quality checks inconsistent
  - Why? Checklist not followed
  - Why? Checklist too complex

[VISUAL: Fishbone with sub-causes branching]

**This creates layers of analysis—surface causes → deeper causes → root causes**

**USING FISHBONE WITH DATA:**

After brainstorming all potential causes, use data to verify which are actual causes.

**Process:**
1. Fishbone generates hypotheses (potential causes)
2. Data analysis tests hypotheses (actual causes)
3. Focus improvement on verified causes

[EXAMPLE]

**Hypotheses from fishbone:** 20 potential causes of defects

**Data analysis (Pareto):**
- Cause A accounts for 45% of defects (verified!)
- Cause B accounts for 28% (verified!)
- Causes C-T account for 27% combined (less critical)

**Conclusion:** Focus on Causes A and B first.

**FISHBONE + 5 WHYS = POWERFUL COMBINATION**

1. Use fishbone to brainstorm many potential causes
2. Use data to identify top 2-3 causes
3. Use 5 Whys on each top cause to find root cause

This combines breadth (fishbone) with depth (5 Whys)!

**[07:00 - 09:00] PARETO ANALYSIS FOR ROOT CAUSE PRIORITIZATION**

Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) helps prioritize which root causes to address first.

[VISUAL: Pareto chart]

**PARETO PRINCIPLE:** 80% of problems come from 20% of causes.

**In practice:** Focus on the "vital few" causes that have biggest impact.

**CREATING PARETO CHART:**

**STEP 1: List all causes with frequency/impact**

Example - Reasons for customer returns:
- Wrong item shipped: 45 returns
- Damaged in transit: 28 returns
- Wrong quantity: 15 returns
- Defective product: 10 returns
- Other: 12 returns

**STEP 2: Sort from highest to lowest**

(Already sorted above)

**STEP 3: Calculate cumulative percentage**

- Wrong item: 45/110 = 41% (cumulative: 41%)
- Damaged: 28/110 = 25% (cumulative: 66%)
- Wrong quantity: 15/110 = 14% (cumulative: 80%)
- Defective: 10/110 = 9% (cumulative: 89%)
- Other: 12/110 = 11% (cumulative: 100%)

**STEP 4: Create chart**

[VISUAL: Pareto chart with bars and cumulative line]

- Bars show individual frequencies
- Line shows cumulative percentage

**INTERPRETATION:**

**First two causes (wrong item + damaged) account for 66% of all returns!**

**Decision:** Focus root cause analysis and improvement efforts on these two causes first.

**APPLYING PARETO TO ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**

After identifying potential causes, use Pareto to quantify impact:

[EXAMPLE - Equipment Downtime]

**Causes of downtime:**
- Bearing failures: 120 hours/year (55%)
- Electrical issues: 45 hours/year (76% cumulative)
- Operator error: 30 hours/year (90% cumulative)
- Software glitches: 15 hours/year (97% cumulative)
- Other: 8 hours/year (100%)

**Pareto insight:** Fix bearing failures → eliminate 55% of downtime!

This focuses improvement efforts on highest-impact root causes.

**[09:00 - 10:15] ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION: DON'T SKIP THIS!**

You've identified potential root causes. But are they actual root causes?

**VERIFICATION METHODS:**

**METHOD 1: DATA CORRELATION**

Test if root cause and problem are correlated.

[EXAMPLE]

**Hypothesis:** Temperature causes defects

**Test:** Plot temperature vs defect rate over time

**Result:** When temp >75°F, defects spike (strong correlation)

**Conclusion:** Temperature IS a root cause (verified!)

**METHOD 2: REMOVE/REDUCE CAUSE (TEST)**

Temporarily eliminate suspected cause, see if problem goes away.

[EXAMPLE]

**Hypothesis:** Supplier X material causes defects

**Test:** Use Supplier Y material for 2 weeks

**Result:** Defects drop 80%

**Conclusion:** Supplier X material IS root cause (verified!)

**METHOD 3: STATISTICAL COMPARISON**

Use hypothesis testing to verify cause.

[EXAMPLE]

**Hypothesis:** Shift C has higher defect rate

**Test:** Compare Shift C defect rate vs Shifts A/B using t-test

**Result:** p-value < 0.05 (statistically significant difference)

**Conclusion:** Shift C IS a contributing cause (verified!)

**WHY VERIFICATION MATTERS:**

Without verification, you might:
- Solve wrong problem (waste time/money)
- Leave real root cause unaddressed (problem continues)
- Implement solution that doesn't work

**Verify before investing in solutions!**

**[10:15 - 10:30] ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST**

Use this checklist for effective RCA:

[VISUAL: Checklist appearing]

✓ **Define problem clearly** (specific, measurable)  
✓ **Brainstorm potential causes** (fishbone, team input)  
✓ **Use data to narrow causes** (don't guess!)  
✓ **Ask "Why?" repeatedly** (5 Whys to find root)  
✓ **Prioritize causes** (Pareto—focus on vital few)  
✓ **Verify root causes** (test correlation, run experiments)  
✓ **Focus on systems, not people** (process issues, not blame)  
✓ **Document analysis** (show your work!)  
✓ **Get team consensus** (shared understanding)

**Common warning signs you haven't found root cause:**

⚠️ Root cause is "operator error" or "people problem" (usually symptom, not root)  
⚠️ Root cause is vague (not specific enough to act on)  
⚠️ Fixing root cause only prevents this specific instance (not similar future problems)  
⚠️ Can't explain mechanism (how does this cause lead to this problem?)

**[10:30 - 10:45] ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IN PRACTICE**

**Real-world example—Hospital Medication Errors:**

**Problem:** 15 medication errors per month

**Fishbone (potential causes):**
- Nurse distraction
- Similar drug names
- Poor handwriting on orders
- Inadequate lighting
- Insufficient training
- Computer system confusing

**Data analysis:**
- 60% of errors involve "sound-alike" drug names (Pareto!)
- Errors occur across all nurses (not training issue)
- Errors cluster in specific drug pairs

**5 Whys (on sound-alike drugs):**
Why errors? Drugs sound similar.  
Why problematic? Computer doesn't flag similarities.  
Why not flagged? No warning system exists.  
**ROOT CAUSE:** No automated checking for sound-alike drugs.

**Verification:** Reviewed error reports—confirmed pattern.

**Solution:** Implement computerized drug name checking system with visual/audio warnings.

**Result:** Errors dropped to 2 per month (87% reduction!)

**[10:45 - 11:00] WRAP-UP & ASSIGNMENT**

Let's recap Root Cause Analysis:

[VISUAL: Summary slide]

✓ **Treat root causes, not symptoms** for permanent solutions  
✓ **5 Whys:** Ask "why" repeatedly until reaching root cause  
✓ **Fishbone:** Brainstorm potential causes across categories  
✓ **Pareto:** Prioritize vital few causes (80/20 rule)  
✓ **Verification:** Use data to confirm root causes before solving  
✓ **Focus on systems:** Process issues, not people blame

**Your assignment:**

**Conduct full root cause analysis on a real problem:**

1. Choose a recurring problem (something that keeps happening)
2. Create fishbone diagram (brainstorm potential causes)
3. Collect data to identify top 2-3 causes (create Pareto chart)
4. Use 5 Whys on top cause to find root cause
5. Verify root cause with data (correlation, testing, comparison)
6. Document your analysis
7. Propose solution that addresses root cause

**This is your chance to solve something permanently!**

In Module 5.4, our final module, we'll cover Implementation & Standardization—ensuring your solutions stick and improvements sustain over time.

## Module 5.4: Implementation & Standardization

**Duration:** 11 minutes | **Word Count:** ~1,400 words

### Script

[VISUAL: Title slide - "Implementation & Standardization" with CI Master Academy logo]

**[00:00 - 00:45] HOOK & INTRODUCTION**

Here's a statistic that should concern every improvement professional:

**70% of organizational change initiatives fail.**

[VISUAL: Statistic appearing dramatically]

Not because the solutions were bad. Not because the analysis was wrong.

They fail because of poor implementation and lack of standardization.

You can have brilliant solutions, but if you:
- Implement them poorly (confuse people, create resistance)
- Don't standardize them (people revert to old ways)
- Don't sustain them (improvements fade over time)

...then you've wasted all that analysis work!

Today, in our final module of the Foundation Belt, we're learning how to implement solutions successfully and standardize improvements so they last.

This is where analysis becomes real, lasting results!

**[00:45 - 02:15] WHY IMPLEMENTATIONS FAIL**

Before learning what works, let's understand what doesn't.

[VISUAL: Common failure modes appearing]

**TOP REASONS IMPLEMENTATIONS FAIL:**

**1. INSUFFICIENT COMMUNICATION**
- People surprised by changes
- Don't understand why change is happening
- Don't know what's expected of them

**2. INADEQUATE TRAINING**
- Expected to adopt new process without preparation
- Don't have skills for new way
- Revert to old familiar methods

**3. NO INVOLVEMENT/BUY-IN**
- Change done TO people, not WITH people
- Feel no ownership
- Passive resistance

**4. CHANGE TOO BIG/TOO FAST**
- Overwhelming amount of change at once
- No time to adapt
- Confusion and errors

**5. NO FOLLOW-UP/MONITORING**
- Implementation declared "done"
- No one checking if actually happening
- Gradual drift back to old ways

**6. LEADERSHIP DOESN'T MODEL CHANGE**
- Leaders say "do this" but don't do it themselves
- Sends message: change isn't really important
- People follow leaders' actions, not words

[EXAMPLE]

**Failed implementation:**
New procedure rolled out Monday via email. No training. No explanation of why. Managers don't follow new procedure themselves. By Friday, half the team reverted to old way.

**Why it failed:** All six failure modes present!

**[02:15 - 05:00] THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: YOUR ROADMAP**

Successful implementation starts with a detailed plan.

[VISUAL: Implementation plan template]

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ELEMENTS:**

**1. WHAT (SPECIFIC CHANGES)**

Document exactly what's changing:
- New procedure (attach document)
- Modified forms/templates
- Updated software/systems
- Physical changes (layout, equipment)
- Policy updates

Be specific—vague plans lead to vague execution!

**2. WHY (RATIONALE)**

Explain why change is happening:
- Problem it solves
- Benefits (efficiency, quality, safety)
- Data supporting change
- Connection to organizational goals

**People support what they understand!**

**3. WHO (ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES)**

- **Implementation leader:** Overall accountability
- **Implementation team:** Execute the plan
- **Stakeholders affected:** Who must adopt changes
- **Support resources:** Training, IT, facilities

**4. WHEN (TIMELINE)**

[VISUAL: Gantt chart or timeline]

- **Preparation phase:** Training, communication, setup
- **Launch date:** When change goes live
- **Milestones:** Key checkpoints
- **Completion date:** When fully implemented

Include buffer time—things always take longer than expected!

**5. WHERE (SCOPE)**

- Which locations? (all sites or phased?)
- Which departments/teams?
- Which products/processes?

**Phased approach often better than "big bang"!**

**6. HOW (DETAILED STEPS)**

Break down into actionable steps:

[EXAMPLE - Implementing New Order Processing System]

**Step 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Configure system
- IT loads software
- Customize workflows
- Import customer data
- Test system functionality

**Step 2 (Week 3):** Train users
- Schedule training sessions
- Conduct hands-on practice
- Provide quick-reference guides
- Set up help desk

**Step 3 (Week 4):** Pilot test
- Run parallel systems (old + new)
- Start with 10 orders
- Collect feedback
- Fix issues

**Step 4 (Week 5):** Full rollout
- All orders use new system
- Retire old system
- Monitor closely first week
- Daily check-ins with team

**Step 5 (Week 6+):** Stabilize & optimize
- Address issues as they arise
- Fine-tune workflows
- Collect efficiency data

**7. COMMUNICATION PLAN**

[VISUAL: Communication timeline]

**Who needs to know what, when?**

- **Leadership:** High-level overview, benefits, timeline
- **Affected staff:** Detailed changes, training schedule, how it affects them
- **Stakeholders:** Relevant updates, status

**Communication methods:**
- Team meetings
- Emails/memos
- Training sessions
- FAQ document
- Office hours for questions

**Rule:** Over-communicate! People need to hear message multiple times to absorb it.

**[05:00 - 07:30] MANAGING CHANGE: THE PEOPLE SIDE**

Implementation isn't just about process—it's about people!

[VISUAL: Change curve]

**TYPICAL CHANGE REACTION STAGES:**

**1. DENIAL/RESISTANCE** (Initial reaction)
"This isn't necessary. We're fine the way we are."

**Your response:**
- Share data showing problem
- Explain rationale patiently
- Listen to concerns (some may be valid!)
- Involve resisters in refining solution

**2. CONFUSION/FRUSTRATION** (During transition)
"I don't understand this. It's taking me longer now!"

**Your response:**
- Provide support and training
- Expect productivity dip initially (normal!)
- Celebrate small wins
- Be patient—learning takes time

**3. EXPLORATION/ACCEPTANCE** (Getting comfortable)
"Okay, I'm starting to see how this works."

**Your response:**
- Encourage experimentation
- Ask for improvement ideas
- Provide positive reinforcement
- Share success stories

**4. INTEGRATION** (New normal)
"This is just how we do it now."

**Your response:**
- Standardize (make it official)
- Stop monitoring as intensely
- Move to periodic audits

**STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE ACCEPTANCE:**

**INVOLVE EARLY**
- Include affected people in solution design
- "This is our solution" vs "their solution forced on us"

**COMMUNICATE THE "WHY"**
- People resist arbitrary change
- People support logical change

**PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING**
- Skill builds confidence
- Confidence reduces resistance

**START WITH CHAMPIONS**
- Identify early adopters
- They influence others
- Create momentum

**MAKE IT EASY**
- Remove barriers to adoption
- Provide tools and resources
- Make new way easier than old way!

**EXPECT AND ADDRESS RESISTANCE**
- Resistance is normal
- Listen to concerns
- Some resistance signals real problems—address them!

[EXAMPLE]

**Resistance:** "New process takes too long!"

**Poor response:** "Just do it anyway."

**Good response:** "Let's time it together. You're right—Step 5 is slow. Let's modify it."

**Result:** Process improved, resister becomes supporter!

**[07:30 - 09:30] STANDARDIZATION: MAKING IMPROVEMENTS STICK**

You've implemented the change. Now how do you ensure it sticks?

[VISUAL: Standardization components]

**STANDARDIZATION = Making the new way the standard way**

**STANDARDIZATION COMPONENTS:**

**1. DOCUMENT THE NEW STANDARD**

Create written standard operating procedures (SOPs):

**SOP should include:**
- Purpose (why we do this)
- Scope (when/where this applies)
- Step-by-step procedure
- Visual aids (photos, flowcharts)
- Quality checkpoints
- Safety requirements
- Expected cycle time
- Troubleshooting guide

**Format:** Simple, visual, accessible (not 50-page manual no one reads!)

[VISUAL: One-page SOP example]

**2. TRAIN TO THE STANDARD**

- All current staff trained
- New hires trained during onboarding
- Refresher training periodically
- Competency verification (not just "attended training")

**3. MAKE STANDARD VISIBLE**

- Post at workstation
- Laminated quick-reference cards
- Digital access via intranet
- Visual management (photos of correct setup)

**If you have to search for the standard, you won't use it!**

**4. BUILD STANDARD INTO SYSTEMS**

Where possible, embed standard into technology:
- Workflow systems enforce sequence
- Checklists prevent skipping steps
- Error-proofing (poka-yoke) makes wrong way impossible

**Example:** Software requires all fields completed before "Submit" button activates.

**5. AUDIT COMPLIANCE**

Regular checks:
- Are people following the standard?
- Is standard still working?
- Do we need to update standard?

**Audits should be:**
- Scheduled (monthly, quarterly)
- Non-punitive (learning, not blame)
- Opportunity to improve standard (standards should evolve!)

**[09:30 - 10:15] SUSTAINING IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME**

Standardization is necessary, but not sufficient. You also need sustaining mechanisms.

[VISUAL: Sustaining mechanisms]

**SUSTAINING MECHANISMS:**

**1. VISUAL MANAGEMENT**

Make performance visible:
- Metrics displayed on dashboards
- Trend charts showing improvement sustained
- Green/yellow/red indicators (status obvious)

**Why:** Makes backsliding immediately visible

**2. REGULAR REVIEW**

- Team huddles (daily/weekly)
- Review metrics
- Discuss issues
- Share successes

**Why:** Keeps focus on maintaining improvement

**3. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MINDSET**

- Standard is current best practice, not final answer
- Encourage ideas to improve the standard
- Regularly update standards

**Why:** Prevents complacency, builds engagement

**4. LEADERSHIP REINFORCEMENT**

- Leaders audit compliance
- Leaders recognize adherence to standards
- Leaders model standard behaviors

**Why:** Signals importance, maintains accountability

**5. CONSEQUENCES (POSITIVE & NEGATIVE)**

- Positive: Recognition for following standards, especially when challenging
- Negative: Accountability when standards ignored without good reason

**Why:** Standards must matter, not be optional

[EXAMPLE - Sustained Improvement]

**5S implementation:**
- Monthly audits with scoring
- Scores posted publicly
- Top-scoring team recognized
- Manager walk-throughs weekly
- Continuous refinement of 5S standards based on feedback

**Result:** 3 years later, 5S maintained at 90%+ compliance. Became "how we work."

**[10:15 - 10:30] WHEN TO UPDATE STANDARDS**

Standards aren't static. Update them when:

✓ Process changes (new equipment, new procedures)  
✓ Better method discovered (someone finds improvement)  
✓ Problem revealed (standard has gap)  
✓ Context changes (regulations, customer requirements)

**Standard updating process:**
1. Proposed change reviewed
2. If approved, standard revised
3. All affected staff notified
4. Training provided if needed
5. Old standard archived (document history)

**[10:30 - 10:45] CELEBRATING SUCCESS**

Don't forget to celebrate!

[VISUAL: Celebration graphics]

Recognition reinforces:
- The improvement mattered
- The team's effort was valuable
- CI culture is alive

**Celebration ideas:**
- Team presentation to leadership
- Before/after photos displayed
- Success story in newsletter
- Team lunch/recognition
- Small rewards (gift cards, certificates)
- Public thank-you from executives

**Remember:** What gets celebrated gets repeated!

**[10:45 - 11:00] WRAP-UP & FINAL ASSIGNMENT**

Let's recap Implementation & Standardization:

[VISUAL: Summary slide]

✓ **Implementation Plan:** What, why, who, when, where, how, communication  
✓ **Change Management:** Involve early, communicate why, train well, expect resistance  
✓ **Standardization:** Document, train, make visible, build into systems, audit  
✓ **Sustainment:** Visual management, regular review, leadership reinforcement
