1. "When was the last time you suggested an improvement to your work process? What happened?"
2. "Do you feel comfortable pointing out problems or inefficiencies? Why or why not?"
3. "How does our organization respond to mistakes—punishment or learning opportunity?"
4. "Are you encouraged to try new approaches, even if they might fail?"
5. "Do you see leadership actively participating in improvement efforts?"

**Step 3:** Score Your Organization (15 minutes)

For each of the 8 principles, rate your organization on a scale of 1-5:
- 1 = Not present at all
- 2 = Rarely evident
- 3 = Sometimes evident

- Write a brief description (2-3 sentences) of how each gap manifests in your organization

**Step 5:** Root Cause Analysis
For each gap, ask "Why does this gap exist?" using the 5 Whys technique.

Example:
- Gap: Low respect for people (score: 2/5)
- Why? → Suggestions are rarely implemented
- Why? → No formal suggestion review process
- Why? → Leadership doesn't prioritize reviewing ideas
- Why? → No accountability for responding to suggestions
- Why? → No system in place to track and respond
- **Root Cause:** Lack of structured suggestion management system

#### Part 3: Improvement Action Plan (60 minutes)

### Materials Needed
- Data collection template (provided)
- Calculator or spreadsheet software (Excel with Data Analysis ToolPak enabled)
- Graph paper or charting software
- Sample dataset (provided) OR real process data from your workplace
- Process specification limits (if using workplace data)

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Data Collection (30-45 minutes)

**Step 1:** Select a Process to Analyze

**Option A - Use Provided Dataset:**
"Coffee Shop Order Fulfillment Time" (sample data for 50 orders provided)

**Option B - Collect Your Own Data:**
Choose a simple, repeatable process such as:
- Email response time (measure time from receipt to send for 30+ emails)
- Commute time to work (record daily for 30+ days)
- Order processing time (measure from order receipt to shipment for 30+ orders)
- Document approval cycle time (30+ document approvals)

**Step 2:** Collect Minimum 30 Data Points

Create a data collection sheet with:
- Date/Time of measurement
- Process instance identifier (Order #, Email #, etc.)
- Measurement value (time in minutes, count, dimension, etc.)
- Any special notes (delays, unusual circumstances)

**Step 3:** Categorize Defects or Issues (if applicable)

If tracking quality issues, categorize by defect type:
- Wrong information
- Missing items
- Damaged goods
- Late delivery
- System errors
- Other

Record frequency of each category.

#### Part 2: Descriptive Statistics Analysis (45 minutes)

**Step 4:** Calculate Central Tendency

Using Excel or calculator, compute:
- **Mean (Average):** Sum all values ÷ count
- **Median:** Middle value when sorted
- **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value
- **Range:** Maximum - Minimum

**Step 5:** Calculate Variation

Compute:
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Measure of spread
  - Excel formula: =STDEV.S(data range)
- **Variance:** Standard deviation squared
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** (σ / mean) × 100%
  - CV < 30% = Low variation
  - CV 30-60% = Moderate variation
  - CV > 60% = High variation

**Step 6:** Interpret the Results

Answer these questions:
1. What is the typical process performance? (Mean)
2. What is the most common outcome? (Mode)
3. How consistent is the process? (Standard deviation)
4. What is the best and worst performance? (Range)
5. Is the variation acceptable for this process? (CV)

#### Part 3: Visual Analysis (60 minutes)

**Step 7:** Create a Histogram

1. Calculate bin size using Sturges' Rule:
   - Number of bins = 1 + 3.322 × log₁₀(n)
   - For n=30: ~6 bins
   - For n=50: ~7 bins

2. Determine bin width:
   - Width = Range ÷ Number of bins

3. Create frequency distribution table:
   - Bin | Frequency | Cumulative %

4. Draw histogram:
   - X-axis: Measurement bins
   - Y-axis: Frequency
   - Draw bars for each bin

5. Analyze distribution shape:
   - Normal (bell curve)?
   - Skewed (left or right)?
   - Bimodal (two peaks)?
   - Truncated (cut off)?

**Step 8:** Create a Pareto Chart (if tracking defect categories)

1. Sort defect categories by frequency (highest to lowest)
2. Calculate cumulative percentage
3. Create combination chart:
   - Bars: Frequency of each category
   - Line: Cumulative percentage
4. Identify the "vital few" (categories causing 80% of problems)

**Step 9:** Interpret Visual Patterns

Write a 1-paragraph interpretation answering:
- What does the distribution shape tell us?
- Are there outliers or unusual patterns?
- What defect categories are most critical? (Pareto)
- What do these patterns suggest about the process?

#### Part 4: Process Capability Analysis (60 minutes)

**Step 10:** Define Specification Limits

Identify or set:
- **Lower Specification Limit (LSL):** Minimum acceptable value
- **Upper Specification Limit (USL):** Maximum acceptable value
- **Target:** Desired/ideal value

Example for coffee shop:
- Target: 3 minutes
- USL: 5 minutes (customer expectation)
- LSL: 1 minute (quality concern if too fast)

**Step 11:** Calculate Process Capability

**Cp (Potential Capability):**
- Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6 × σ)
- Assumes process is centered on target
- Cp < 1.0 = Incapable
- Cp = 1.33 = Capable (industry standard)
- Cp ≥ 2.0 = Excellent

**Cpk (Actual Capability):**
- CPU = (USL - Mean) / (3 × σ)
- CPL = (Mean - LSL) / (3 × σ)
- Cpk = Minimum of (CPU, CPL)
- Accounts for process centering

**Step 12:** Assess Current Performance

Calculate:
- % of data points within specification
- % of data points above USL (too slow/large)
- % of data points below LSL (too fast/small)
- Defects per million opportunities (DPMO)

**Step 13:** Identify Improvement Opportunities

Based on your analysis:

**If Cpk < 1.0:** Process is incapable
- Action: Investigate root causes of variation
- Focus: Reduce variation AND center the process

**If Cp good but Cpk poor:** Process off-center
- Action: Adjust process mean (easier fix)
- Focus: Center the process on target

**If Both Cp and Cpk < 1.33:** High variation
- Action: Reduce process variation
- Focus: Identify and eliminate sources of variation

#### Part 5: Recommendations Report (45 minutes)

**Step 14:** Create Improvement Recommendations

Write recommendations addressing:

1. **Process Centering:**
   - Is the mean on target?
   - If not, what adjustment is needed?
   - Quick win opportunity?

2. **Variation Reduction:**
   - What are the sources of variation? (review outliers, patterns)
   - Which sources can be controlled?
   - What's causing the high/low extremes?

3. **Capability Improvement:**
   - What's needed to achieve Cpk ≥ 1.33?
   - Realistic timeline?
   - Required resources?

**Step 15:** Compile Final Report

Create a 4-5 page report with:

**Section 1: Process Description**

- Email inbox management (high volume, slow response)
- Morning routine (frequently late to work)
- Document approval process (long cycle time)
- Meeting effectiveness (too long, unproductive)
- Report generation (time-consuming, error-prone)

**Criteria:**
- You experience this problem regularly (daily/weekly)
- It's measurable (time, count, accuracy)
- You have authority to make changes
- Can collect 20+ data points over 1-2 weeks
- Has business/personal impact

**Step 2:** Create Project Charter

Complete each section:

**Project Title:** Brief, descriptive name

**Problem Statement:**
Use formula: What + Where + When + Impact

Example:
"Email response time in Customer Service department has increased from 4 hours to 12 hours over the past 3 months, resulting in 15 customer complaints per week and declining satisfaction scores (from 85% to 72%)."

Requirements:
- Specific (not vague)
- Measurable (quantified)
- Time-bound (when it started)
- Impact stated (business case)

**Goal Statement:**
Use SMART format

Example:
"Reduce email response time from current 12 hours to 4 hours by [date 6 weeks from now], improving customer satisfaction to 85%+ and reducing complaints to 3 per week."

**Scope:**
- In scope: Customer service emails, Monday-Friday business hours
- Out of scope: Phone calls, weekend emails, technical support tickets

**Team (if applicable):**
- Project Lead: [Your name]
- Team Members: [Names]
- Sponsor: [Manager name]

**Timeline:**
- Define: Week 1
- Measure: Week 1-2
- Analyze: Week 2-3
- Improve: Week 3-4
- Control: Week 4+

**Step 3:** Define Customer Requirements (Voice of Customer)

Identify:
- Who are the customers? (internal or external)
- What do they need/expect?
- How will you know if they're satisfied?

Create simple VOC table:

| Customer | Requirement | How to Measure | Current | Target |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| | | | | |

#### Phase 2: MEASURE (2-3 hours over 1-2 weeks)

**Step 4:** Plan Data Collection

Define:
- **What** to measure (response time, error rate, cycle time)
- **How** to measure (stopwatch, checklist, count)
- **When** to measure (every instance, daily sample)
- **Who** will measure (you, automated system)
- **How many** data points (minimum 20-30)

Create operational definition:
- Exactly how will you measure?
- When does measurement start and stop?
- What counts and what doesn't?

Example for email response time:
"Response time = time from email receipt (timestamp in inbox) to time response is sent (timestamp in sent folder), measured in hours and minutes. Measure for all customer emails received Monday-Friday 8am-5pm. Exclude out-of-office periods and emails requiring escalation."

**Step 5:** Collect Baseline Data

Create data collection log:

| Date | Instance # | Measurement | Notes |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| | | | |

Collect 20-30 data points over 1-2 weeks

**Step 6:** Calculate Baseline Statistics

Using your data:

**Central Tendency:**
- Mean: ___
- Median: ___
- Mode: ___

**Variation:**
- Standard Deviation: ___
- Range: ___ to ___
- Coefficient of Variation: ___% 

**Performance:**
- % meeting target: ___%
- Best performance: ___
- Worst performance: ___

**Step 7:** Create Baseline Visualizations

1. **Histogram:**
   - Shows distribution of data
   - Identify if normal, skewed, bimodal

2. **Run Chart:**
   - Plot data over time
   - Look for trends or patterns

3. **Box Plot (optional):**
   - Shows median, quartiles, outliers

**Step 8:** Calculate Process Capability (if spec limits exist)

If you have target/specification limits:

- Target: ___
- Upper Spec Limit: ___
- Lower Spec Limit: ___

Calculate:
- Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ): ___
- Cpk = min[(USL-mean)/(3σ), (mean-LSL)/(3σ)]: ___

Interpretation:
- Cpk < 1.0: Process incapable
- Cpk 1.0-1.33: Marginally capable
- Cpk > 1.33: Capable

#### Phase 3: ANALYZE (90-120 minutes)

**Step 9:** Analyze Data Patterns

Review your charts and ask:
1. What patterns do you see?
2. When does performance deviate from target?
3. Are there outliers? What caused them?
4. Is there a trend over time?
5. What factors correlate with good/poor performance?

**Step 10:** Brainstorm Potential Causes

Use Fishbone Diagram with 6Ms:

**Man (People):**
- Training? Experience? Workload?

**Machine (Equipment):**
- Tools? Technology? Software?

**Material (Inputs):**
- Information? Quality of inputs?

**Method (Process):**
- Procedures? Complexity? Handoffs?

**Measurement:**
- How measured? Consistency?

**Mother Nature (Environment):**
- Time of day? Distractions? Workspace?

List 15-20 potential causes

**Step 11:** Apply 5 Whys to Top Causes

Select 3-5 most likely causes and drill down:

Example:
- Problem: Slow email response
- Why? → Emails go unanswered for hours
- Why? → No system to track which emails answered
- Why? → Use inbox as to-do list, emails get lost
- Why? → No email management system in place
- **Root Cause:** Lack of systematic email management process

**Step 12:** Verify Root Causes with Data

For each suspected root cause, look at data:

Test 1: Stratify data by suspected cause
- Does performance differ when cause is present vs. absent?

Example:
- Morning emails (before 10am): Average 2 hours response
- Afternoon emails (after 2pm): Average 6 hours response
- **Finding:** Time of day affects response time (possible cause: afternoon meetings create backlog)

Test 2: Look for correlations
- Does change in cause = change in effect?

Document which causes are verified by data vs. just opinions.

#### Phase 4: IMPROVE (2-3 hours)

**Step 13:** Brainstorm Solutions

For each verified root cause, generate 3-5 potential solutions:

| Root Cause | Potential Solution | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|------------|-------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| | | | | |

Use Impact vs. Effort matrix:
- High Impact + Low Effort = Do First (Quick Wins)
- High Impact + High Effort = Plan Carefully
- Low Impact + Low Effort = Fill-in when time permits
- Low Impact + High Effort = Avoid

**Step 14:** Select Top 2-3 Solutions

Based on:
- Highest impact on root cause
- Feasibility with your resources
- Quick to implement (for this exercise)
- Minimal risk

**Step 15:** Create Implementation Plan

For each solution:

**What:** Description of solution

**Why:** How it addresses root cause

**How:** Step-by-step implementation
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Who:** Responsible party

**When:** Timeline/deadlines

**Resources:** What's needed

**Risks:** What could go wrong, mitigation

**Success Metrics:** How measure improvement

**Step 16:** Implement Solution

Execute your plan:
- Follow steps
- Document what you do
- Note any deviations from plan
- Track issues and adjustments

**Step 17:** Collect Post-Implementation Data

After implementation, collect another 20-30 data points using same method as baseline:

| Date | Instance # | Measurement | Notes |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| | | | |

#### Phase 5: CONTROL (60 minutes)

**Step 18:** Calculate Improvement

Compare baseline vs. improved state:

| Metric | Baseline | Improved | Change | % Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Mean | | | | |
| Std Dev | | | | |
| % Meeting Target | | | | |
| Best | | | | |
| Worst | | | | |

Create before/after charts:
- Histograms side-by-side
- Run charts with implementation date marked

**Step 19:** Verify Goal Achievement

Review goal statement:
- Was goal met? Yes/No
- If yes: Celebrate! Document lessons
- If no: Why not? What's missing? Next steps?

**Step 20:** Create Control Plan

To sustain improvement, document:

**What to Monitor:**
- Key metrics (what indicates process is healthy?)
- Measurement frequency (daily? weekly?)
- Who monitors

**Control Limits:**
- What variation is acceptable?
- When to take action

**Response Plan:**

Create problem list with impact:

| Problem | Type | Impact | Frequency | Priority |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| | | | | |

**Step 7:** Select Top 3 Problems to Analyze

Use Pareto principle:
- Which problems cause 80% of the pain?
- Prioritize based on impact × frequency

**Step 8:** Apply Multiple Root Cause Analysis Tools

**For Problem #1:** Use Fishbone Diagram

Create fishbone with 6 categories:
- Man (People)
- Machine (Equipment/Technology)
- Material (Inputs/Information)
- Method (Process/Procedures)
- Measurement
- Mother Nature (Environment)

Brainstorm 10-15 potential causes across categories

**For Problem #2:** Use 5 Whys

Problem: [State problem]
- Why? → [Answer 1]
- Why? → [Answer 2]
- Why? → [Answer 3]
- Why? → [Answer 4]
- Why? → [Answer 5 - Root Cause]

Continue until you reach actionable root cause

**For Problem #3:** Use Pareto Analysis (if multiple sub-issues)

If problem has categories (error types, delay reasons):
1. Count frequency of each category
2. Sort from highest to lowest
3. Calculate cumulative %
4. Create Pareto chart
5. Focus on vital few (top 2-3 causing 80%)

**Step 9:** Verify Root Causes

For each suspected root cause:

**Test with data:**
- Is there evidence this cause creates the problem?
- When cause is present, is problem present?
- When cause is absent, is problem absent?

**Test with logic:**
- Does it make sense?
- Is it actionable?
- Would fixing it prevent recurrence?

Mark verified root causes for solution development

#### Part 3: Solution Development & Future State (90 minutes)

**Step 10:** Brainstorm Solutions

For each verified root cause, generate 5-10 potential solutions:

- Can we combine steps?
- Can we reorder steps (parallel not sequential)?
- Can we automate?
- Can we reduce handoffs?
- Can we simplify?
- Can we mistake-proof (poka-yoke)?

Use SCAMPER technique:
- **S**ubstitute: Replace with something else?
- **C**ombine: Merge with another step?
- **A**dapt: Adjust for new purpose?
- **M**odify: Change size, shape, attributes?
- **P**ut to other use: Different application?
- **E**liminate: Remove entirely?
- **R**everse: Change order or process?

**Step 11:** Evaluate & Prioritize Solutions

Create evaluation matrix:

| Solution | Impact (1-5) | Ease (1-5) | Cost (1-5) | Risk (1-5) | Total Score | Priority |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| | | | | | | |

Scoring:
- **Impact:** 5=High improvement, 1=Low improvement
- **Ease:** 5=Very easy, 1=Very difficult
- **Cost:** 5=Free, 1=Very expensive
- **Risk:** 5=No risk, 1=High risk

Plot on Impact vs. Effort matrix:
- **Quick Wins:** High impact, easy to implement → Do first!
- **Major Projects:** High impact, difficult → Plan carefully
- **Fill-ins:** Low impact, easy → Do when time permits
- **Avoid:** Low impact, difficult → Don't do
