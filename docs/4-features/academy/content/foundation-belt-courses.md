## COURSE 2: BASIC STATISTICS FOR CI

### Short Description

Master the essential statistical concepts you need for data-driven process improvement without getting lost in complex mathematics. Learn to collect, analyze, and interpret data like a Six Sigma professional, making confident decisions based on facts rather than opinions.

### Full Description

Statistics might sound intimidating, but this course makes it accessible, practical, and even enjoyable! You'll learn exactly what you need to know—no more, no less—to use data effectively in your improvement projects.

**What You'll Learn:**
Through four focused modules, you'll discover how to distinguish between different types of data (continuous vs. discrete, qualitative vs. quantitative) and why this matters for your analysis. You'll master descriptive statistics—mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation—understanding not just how to calculate them, but what they actually mean for your process. You'll learn the art and science of data visualization, creating charts and graphs that clearly communicate your findings and avoiding common pitfalls that can mislead your audience. Finally, you'll explore the normal distribution (the famous "bell curve"), understand probability basics, and learn how Six Sigma uses these concepts to predict and prevent defects.

**Who This Course Is For:**
This course is perfect for anyone who's ever felt overwhelmed by statistics or said "I'm not a math person." We've designed it specifically for practitioners who need to use statistics for real projects, not for academic mathematicians. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or use Excel to do it for you!), you have all the math skills you need. We focus on concepts, interpretation, and practical application rather than complex formulas.

**What You'll Be Able To Do:**
After completing this course, you'll confidently determine what type of data you have and how to collect it properly. You'll calculate and interpret basic statistics using Excel (no complex software required). You'll create professional charts and graphs that tell compelling stories with data. You'll assess whether your process data is normally distributed and understand what that means for improvement efforts. You'll speak the language of Six Sigma professionals, understanding terms like "variation," "distribution," and "sigma level." Most importantly, you'll make data-driven decisions with confidence, backing up your improvement recommendations with solid evidence.

**Prerequisites:**
Course 1: Introduction to Process Improvement (or equivalent knowledge). Basic Microsoft Excel skills helpful but not required—we'll show you the Excel functions you need.

**Time Commitment:**
Approximately 4-5 hours of video content, plus 3-4 hours for practice exercises and quizzes. Most students complete this in 1-2 weeks. We strongly recommend doing the practice exercises—statistics is a skill you learn by doing, not just watching!

**Why This Matters:**
"In God we trust; all others must bring data." This famous quote captures why statistical thinking is so crucial to CI. Organizations that make decisions based on data rather than gut feelings achieve 3-5 times better results from their improvement projects. You don't need a statistics degree—you just need to understand enough to collect good data, analyze it correctly, and present your findings convincingly. These skills immediately elevate you from "someone with opinions" to "someone with evidence," dramatically increasing your credibility and influence in any organization.

**What You'll Be Able To Do:**
Upon completion, you'll walk through any workplace and immediately spot the 8 wastes, estimating their impact on time, cost, and quality. You'll facilitate a 5S event in your area, creating dramatic before-and-after improvements in just one day. You'll create a current-state Value Stream Map for any process, calculate lead time vs. value-added time, and identify improvement opportunities. You'll design simple visual management systems using Kanban principles. You'll understand why Lean works psychologically and culturally, not just mechanically. Most excitingly, you'll be ready to lead your first Kaizen event—a rapid improvement workshop that can transform a process in just 3-5 days.

**Prerequisites:**
Courses 1 and 2, or equivalent knowledge of CI fundamentals and basic statistics.

**Time Commitment:**
Approximately 5-6 hours of video content, plus 4-5 hours for practical exercises (including creating your own Value Stream Map). Plan for 2-3 weeks to complete with proper practice time. The hands-on exercises are the heart of this course—you'll learn by doing, not just listening.

**Why This Matters:**
Lean organizations operate at fundamentally different levels than traditional organizations. They're typically 30-50% more efficient, 50-70% faster, and achieve 40-80% higher quality—while simultaneously improving employee satisfaction and customer loyalty. Companies like Toyota, Amazon, and Zara have built competitive advantages that seem almost unfair, all based on Lean principles. Healthcare organizations using Lean have reduced patient wait times by 50-75%, saved thousands of lives through error reduction, and simultaneously reduced costs.
