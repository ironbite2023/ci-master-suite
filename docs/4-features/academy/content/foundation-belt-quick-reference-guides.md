# GUIDE 3: Statistical Formulas Cheat Sheet

**Purpose:** Quick reference for common CI calculations  
**Use:** During data analysis, Measure/Analyze phases, capability studies

---

## DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

### **Mean (Average)**
```
x̄ = (Σx) ÷ n
```
- **Σx** = Sum of all data points
- **n** = Number of data points
- **Use:** Measure of central tendency
- **Example:** (10+12+14+16+18) ÷ 5 = 14

---

### **Median**
```
Middle value when data is ordered
```
- **Even n:** Average of two middle values
- **Odd n:** Middle value
- **Use:** Central tendency less affected by outliers
- **Example:** 10, 12, **14**, 16, 18 → Median = 14

---

### **Mode**
```
Most frequently occurring value
```
- **Use:** Identify most common value
- **Note:** Dataset can have multiple modes or no mode

---

### **Range**
```
Range = Maximum - Minimum
```
- **Use:** Simple measure of spread
- **Example:** Max=18, Min=10 → Range = 8

---

### **Standard Deviation (Sample)**
```
s = √[Σ(x - x̄)² ÷ (n-1)]
```
- **s** = Sample standard deviation
- **x** = Individual data point
- **x̄** = Sample mean
- **n** = Sample size
- **Use:** Measure of variation around mean
- **Note:** Population SD uses n instead of n-1

---

### **Variance**
```
s² = Σ(x - x̄)² ÷ (n-1)
```
- **Use:** Standard deviation squared
- **Note:** Same units² as data (harder to interpret)

---

### **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
```
CV = (s ÷ x̄) × 100%
```
- **Use:** Compare variation across different scales
- **Expressed as:** Percentage
- **Example:** s=2, x̄=50 → CV = 4%

---

## PROCESS CAPABILITY

### **Cp (Process Capability - Potential)**
```
Cp = (USL - LSL) ÷ (6σ)
```
- **USL** = Upper Specification Limit
- **LSL** = Lower Specification Limit
- **σ** = Standard deviation
- **Interpretation:**
  - Cp ≥ 1.33 = Capable
  - Cp = 1.00 = Barely capable
  - Cp < 1.00 = Not capable
- **Note:** Assumes process is centered

---

### **Cpk (Process Capability - Actual)**
```
Cpk = min[Cpu, Cpl]

Where:
Cpu = (USL - x̄) ÷ (3σ)
Cpl = (x̄ - LSL) ÷ (3σ)
```
- **x̄** = Process mean
- **Interpretation:**
  - Cpk ≥ 1.33 = Capable
  - Cpk = 1.00 = Barely capable
  - Cpk < 1.00 = Not capable
- **Note:** Accounts for process centering

---

### **Sigma Level**
```
Sigma Level ≈ (Cpk × 3) + 1.5

Or use DPMO table:
3σ = 66,807 DPMO
4σ = 6,210 DPMO
5σ = 233 DPMO
6σ = 3.4 DPMO
```

---

### **DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities)**
```
DPMO = (Defects ÷ Opportunities) × 1,000,000
```
- **Example:** 50 defects in 10,000 opportunities
  - DPMO = (50 ÷ 10,000) × 1,000,000 = 5,000 DPMO
  - This ≈ 4 sigma level

---

## LEAN METRICS

### **Takt Time**
```
Takt Time = Available Work Time ÷ Customer Demand
```
- **Example:** 480 min available, 240 units needed
  - Takt = 480 ÷ 240 = 2 minutes per unit
- **Use:** Set production pace to match demand

---

### **Cycle Time**
```
Cycle Time = Total Process Time (including delays)
```
- **Measured:** Minutes, hours, days
- **Goal:** Reduce to approach Takt Time

---

### **Lead Time**
```
Lead Time = Time from customer request to delivery
```
- **Customer perspective:** Includes all wait times
- **Goal:** Minimize while maintaining quality

---

### **Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE)**
```
PCE = (Value-Added Time ÷ Total Lead Time) × 100%
```
- **Example:** 2 hours VA time, 40 hours lead time
  - PCE = (2 ÷ 40) × 100% = 5%
- **Typical:** 5-10% in most processes
- **World-class:** >25%

---

### **Little's Law**
```
Lead Time = WIP ÷ Throughput
```
- **WIP** = Work-in-Process inventory
- **Throughput** = Rate of completion
- **Use:** Understand relationship between WIP and lead time

---

### **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
```
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

Where:
Availability = (Operating Time ÷ Planned Time)
Performance = (Actual Output ÷ Theoretical Output)
Quality = (Good Units ÷ Total Units)
```
- **World-class OEE:** >85%
- **Example:** 0.90 × 0.95 × 0.98 = 0.84 (84% OEE)

---

## STATISTICAL TESTS

### **Z-Score**
```
Z = (x - μ) ÷ σ
```
- **Use:** How many standard deviations from mean
- **Example:** x=120, μ=100, σ=10 → Z = 2.0

---

### **Empirical Rule (Normal Distribution)**
```
±1σ = 68% of data
±2σ = 95% of data
±3σ = 99.7% of data
```

---

### **Sample Size (for proportion)**
```
n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) ÷ E²
```
- **Z** = Z-score for confidence level (1.96 for 95%)
- **p** = Expected proportion (use 0.5 if unknown)
- **E** = Margin of error
- **Example:** 95% confidence, ±5% error
  - n = (1.96² × 0.5 × 0.5) ÷ 0.05² = 384

---

## CONTROL CHARTS

### **Control Limits (Individual-X Chart)**
```
Center Line (CL) = x̄

UCL = x̄ + 3σ
LCL = x̄ - 3σ
```
- **UCL** = Upper Control Limit
- **LCL** = Lower Control Limit

---

### **Control Limits (X-bar Chart)**
```
UCL = x̄ + A₂ × R̄
LCL = x̄ - A₂ × R̄
```
- **A₂** = Constant based on subgroup size (from table)
- **R̄** = Average range

---

## QUICK CALCULATION TIPS

**Estimating Standard Deviation:**
```
σ ≈ Range ÷ 4 (for n=30)
σ ≈ Range ÷ 5 (for n=100)
```

**Estimating Sigma Level from Defect Rate:**
- 1% defects ≈ 2.7σ
- 0.1% defects ≈ 3.8σ
- 0.01% defects ≈ 4.8σ
- 0.001% defects ≈ 5.8σ

**Converting between metrics:**
```
PPM = (Defect Rate) × 1,000,000
Yield = 1 - Defect Rate
```

**Use:** During problem-solving, Analyze phase, incident investigations

---

## RCA PROCESS OVERVIEW

**Step 1:** Define the problem clearly (specific, measurable)  
**Step 2:** Brainstorm potential causes (generate many)  
**Step 3:** Use data to narrow causes (test with data)  
**Step 4:** Drill to root causes (ask "why" repeatedly)  
**Step 5:** Verify root causes (statistical tests)  
**Step 6:** Prioritize (focus on vital few)

**Timeline:** 1-4 weeks depending on complexity

---

## TOOL 1: FISHBONE DIAGRAM (ISHIKAWA)

### When to Use
- Brainstorming many potential causes
- Organizing causes by category
- Team-based problem-solving
- Visual representation needed

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Draw problem as "fish head" on right  
**Step 2:** Draw main "bones" - 6 categories:
- **M**ethods (procedures, processes)
- **M**achines (equipment, technology)
- **M**aterials (inputs, supplies)
- **M**easurements (how we measure)
- **M**other Nature (environment, conditions)
- **M**anpower / People (training, skills)

**Step 3:** Team brainstorms causes for each category  
**Step 4:** Ask "Why?" for each cause to go deeper  
**Step 5:** Circle most likely causes for data verification

### Example Structure
```
    Methods          Machines
      |                 |
      |                 |

      |                 |
   Materials       Measurements
      
   (Add Mother Nature and Manpower below)
```

### Pro Tips
- Generate 30-50 potential causes (quantity over quality initially)
- No criticism during brainstorming
- Involve people who do the work
- Use data to verify causes after brainstorming

---

## TOOL 2: 5 WHYS

### When to Use
- Drilling from symptoms to root causes
- Quick RCA (minutes to hours)
- Single-stream problems
- Building on Fishbone results

### How to Use

**Start with problem → Ask "Why?" → Answer → Ask "Why?" again → Repeat ~5 times**

**Example:**

**Problem:** Customer shipment was late

**Why #1:** Why was shipment late?  
**Answer:** Warehouse didn't process order in time

**Why #2:** Why didn't warehouse process in time?  
**Answer:** They were understaffed that day

**Why #3:** Why understaffed?  
**Answer:** Two employees called in sick

**Why #4:** Why did both calling in cause delay?  
**Answer:** No cross-training backup plan exists

**Why #5:** Why no backup plan?  
**Answer:** No formal process for ensuring redundancy

**ROOT CAUSE:** Lack of formal redundancy planning process

**Solution:** Create cross-training program and backup staffing protocols

### How to Know You've Reached Root Cause

✓ Fixing this will prevent recurrence  
✓ Cause is actionable (within your control)  
✓ Cause is a system/process issue (not blaming person)  
✓ Can't meaningfully ask "why" again

### Common Mistakes

❌ Stopping too early (symptoms, not root causes)  
❌ Blaming people ("operator error") instead of systems  
❌ Guessing instead of verifying with data  
❌ Going down wrong path

### Pro Tips
- Use data to verify each "why"
- May need fewer or more than 5 whys
- Focus on systems, not people
- Document your logic

---

## TOOL 3: PARETO ANALYSIS

### When to Use
- Prioritizing causes by impact
- Focusing on "vital few" vs. "trivial many"
- Data is available for causes
- Need to allocate limited resources

### 80/20 Rule
**80% of problems typically come from 20% of causes**

### How to Create Pareto Chart

**Step 1:** List all causes with frequency/impact data  
**Step 2:** Sort from highest to lowest  
**Step 3:** Calculate cumulative percentage  
**Step 4:** Create bar chart (sorted) with cumulative line  
**Step 5:** Identify causes in "vital few" (usually 2-3 causes causing 80%)

### Example

| Cause | Count | % | Cumulative % |
|-------|-------|---|--------------|
| Cause A | 45 | 45% | 45% |
| Cause B | 28 | 28% | 73% |
| Cause C | 15 | 15% | 88% |
| Cause D | 8 | 8% | 96% |
| Other | 4 | 4% | 100% |

**Insight:** Causes A & B account for 73% of problem → Focus here!

### Pro Tips
- Always include "Other" category
- Can apply Pareto to Pareto (drill down on Cause A)
- Update as you eliminate top causes
- Combine with stratification for deeper insights

---

## TOOL 4: STRATIFICATION

### When to Use
- Patterns hidden in aggregate data
- Suspected cause needs verification
- Available subgroup data
- Want to see detailed breakdown

### Common Stratification Factors
- Time (shift, day of week, season)
- Location (plant, line, workstation)
- People (operator, team, department)
- Equipment (machine, tool, model)
- Material (lot, supplier, batch)
- Method (procedure version, training level)

### Example

**Aggregate:** Overall defect rate = 5%

**Stratified by Shift:**
- Shift A: 2% ❌
- Shift B: 3% ❌
- Shift C: 10% ✅ **CAUSE IDENTIFIED!**

**Conclusion:** Problem is shift-specific → Investigate Shift C processes, training, supervision

### Pro Tips
- Stratify by multiple factors simultaneously
- Use visuals (separate histograms, box plots)
- Look for factors with largest differences
- Verify significance with statistical tests

---

## TOOL 5: SCATTER PLOTS (CORRELATION ANALYSIS)

### When to Use
- Testing if two variables are related
- Visualizing potential cause-effect relationship
- Continuous data available
- Want quick visual analysis

### How to Create
- X-axis: Suspected cause (independent variable)
- Y-axis: Problem metric (dependent variable)
- Plot each data point
- Look for pattern

### Patterns & Interpretation

**Positive Correlation:** As X increases, Y increases  
→ Possible cause relationship

**Negative Correlation:** As X increases, Y decreases  
→ Possible inverse cause relationship

**No Correlation:** Random scatter  
→ Not related (not a cause)

### Example
- X-axis: Temperature (°F)
- Y-axis: Defect rate (%)
- Pattern: Upward trend
- **Conclusion:** Temperature appears to cause defects → Verify with test

### Important Caution
**Correlation does NOT prove causation!**
- Always verify with additional analysis
- Consider confounding variables
- Use hypothesis testing for statistical proof

---

## TOOL 6: HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### When to Use
- Verifying if differences are real vs. random chance
- Providing statistical proof of cause
- Comparing groups or time periods
- Supporting RCA with statistics

### Common Tests

**Comparing Two Means:**
- **t-test** (e.g., Shift A vs. Shift B defect rates)

**Comparing 3+ Means:**
- **ANOVA** (e.g., All shifts, all machines)

**Comparing Proportions:**
- **Chi-square** (e.g., Pass/fail rates by department)

**Testing Correlation:**
- **Regression** (e.g., Temperature impact on yield)

### Interpretation

**p-value < 0.05:** Statistically significant (cause verified!)  
**p-value ≥ 0.05:** Not statistically significant (may not be cause)

### Example
**Hypothesis:** Machine A has higher defect rate than Machine B

**Data:**
- Machine A: 8% defects
- Machine B: 5% defects

**Test:** 2-sample t-test  
**Result:** p-value = 0.02

**Conclusion:** p < 0.05 → Difference is statistically significant → Machine A IS a cause

### Pro Tips
- Let software do calculations (Minitab, Excel, JMP)
- Understand which test to use (ask statistician if unsure)
- Statistical significance ≠ practical significance
- Always interpret in context

## RCA WORKFLOW

```
START → Define Problem (specific, measurable)
  ↓
Brainstorm Causes (Fishbone with team)
  ↓
Collect Data (on potential causes)
  ↓
Prioritize Causes (Pareto analysis)
  ↓
Stratify Data (by suspected factors)
  ↓
Test Correlation (Scatter plots)
  ↓
Drill to Root (5 Whys on top causes)
  ↓
Verify Statistically (Hypothesis testing)
  ↓
Document Root Causes (top 2-3 verified)
  ↓
Develop Solutions → Implement → Control
```

**Timeline:** 1-4 weeks depending on complexity

---

## ROOT CAUSE VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Before claiming you've found root cause, verify:**

□ Verified with data (not assumptions)  
□ Statistically significant (if tested)  
□ Fixing it will prevent recurrence (not just this instance)  
□ Actionable (within control to fix)  
□ System/process issue (not blaming people)  
□ Team consensus achieved  
□ Can explain cause-effect mechanism  
□ Documented with evidence

**Warning Signs You Haven't Found Root Cause:**
⚠️ "Operator error" or "human error" (go deeper!)  
⚠️ Vague cause (not specific enough to act on)  
⚠️ No data supporting the cause  
⚠️ Can't explain how cause creates problem

---

## COMMON RCA MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Jumping to Solutions
❌ **Wrong:** "We need new equipment" (that's a solution!)  
✅ **Right:** "Equipment downtime causes delays" (that's a problem to analyze)

### Mistake 2: Blaming People
❌ **Wrong:** "John made a mistake"  
✅ **Right:** "No verification step exists to catch errors"

### Mistake 3: Stopping at Symptoms
❌ **Wrong:** "Part failed"  
✅ **Right:** "Part failed because no preventive maintenance system exists"

### Mistake 4: No Data Verification
❌ **Wrong:** "We think it's the temperature"  
✅ **Right:** "Data shows defects spike when temp >75°F (p=0.001)"

### Mistake 5: Too Many Root Causes
❌ **Wrong:** Identifying 15 root causes  
✅ **Right:** Focus on vital few (2-3 causes creating 80% of problem)
