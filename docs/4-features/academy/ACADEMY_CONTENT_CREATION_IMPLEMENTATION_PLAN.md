- Module 1.5: Overview of Six Sigma Principles (5 questions)

#### **SAMPLE HIGH-QUALITY QUESTION:**

```json
{
  "question": "A manufacturing company successfully implemented Lean principles and reduced their production lead time from 30 days to 5 days while maintaining quality. Which core Lean principle is MOST directly responsible for this improvement?",
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "options": [
    "Just-In-Time (JIT) production and flow optimization",
    "5S workplace organization methodology",
    "Kaizen continuous improvement mindset",
    "Respect for people and employee empowerment"
  ],
  "correct_answer": 0,
  "explanation": "Just-In-Time (JIT) production is the correct answer because it directly addresses lead time reduction by producing only what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed. JIT eliminates waiting time, reduces work-in-process inventory, and creates continuous flow—all of which dramatically reduce lead time from 30 days to 5 days.\n\nWhy the other options are less correct:\n- 5S (Option B) is valuable for workplace organization and finding tools quickly, but it doesn't directly address production lead time reduction. It's a supporting tool, not the primary driver of 25-day lead time reduction.\n- Kaizen (Option C) is the mindset of continuous improvement that enables Lean, but it's the philosophy behind the change, not the specific principle that reduces lead time. Kaizen could lead to implementing JIT.\n- Respect for people (Option D) is a foundational cultural principle in Lean, but it doesn't directly reduce lead time. However, respecting employees' ideas might lead them to suggest JIT improvements.\n\nReal-world context: Toyota's implementation of JIT reduced their production lead time from months to days, revolutionizing manufacturing. They could build a car to customer specification in just 5 days versus the 30+ days of traditional mass production. This is the principle that has been replicated across industries—from healthcare (patient flow) to software development (DevOps).",

```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All required tables exist
- [ ] Column data types match content format
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are correct
- [ ] Indexes are set up for performance

---

#### **Step 2: Prepare SQL Insert Scripts (3 hours)**

**Create organized SQL files:**

**File: `insert-courses.sql`**
```sql
-- Course 1: Introduction to Process Improvement
INSERT INTO courses (
  id, 
  title, 
  short_description,
  full_description,
  belt_level,
  order,
  duration_hours,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '1',
  'Introduction to Process Improvement',
  '[Your short description from Phase 1]',
  '[Your full description from Phase 1]',
  'foundation',
  1,
  5.0,
  NOW()
);

-- Repeat for all 5 courses
```

**File: `insert-lessons.sql`**
```sql
-- Lesson 1.1: History & Evolution of CI
INSERT INTO lessons (
  id,
  course_id,
  title,
  description,
  transcript,
  order,
  duration_minutes,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '1-1',
  '1',
  'History & Evolution of CI',
  '[Your lesson description from Phase 1]',
  '[Your video script from Phase 4/5]',
  1,
  12,
  NOW()
);

-- Repeat for all 21 lessons
```

**File: `insert-quiz-questions.sql`**
```sql
-- Import from JSON files
-- Use tool to convert JSON to SQL INSERT statements
-- Or use Supabase import feature for JSON

-- Example:
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (
  id,
  lesson_id,
  question,
  type,
  options,
  correct_answer,
  explanation,
  difficulty,
  learning_objective,
  estimated_time_seconds
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '1-1',
  '[Question text]',
  'multiple_choice',
  '["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]'::jsonb,
  0,
  '[Explanation]',
  'beginner',
  'LO-1.1.1',
  60
);

-- Repeat for all 105 questions
```

**File: `insert-exercises.sql`**
```sql
INSERT INTO exercises (
  id,
  lesson_id,
  title,
  instructions,
  deliverable,
  grading_criteria,
  estimated_time_hours
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '3-1',
  'Identify Wastes in Your Workplace',
  '[Your instructions from Phase 3]',
  '[Your deliverable description]',
  '[Your grading rubric]',
  2.5
);

-- Repeat for all 5 exercises
```

**File: `insert-case-studies.sql`**
```sql
INSERT INTO case_studies (
  id,
  lesson_id,
  title,
  content,
  discussion_questions,
  estimated_reading_time_minutes
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '1-1',
  'Toyota''s Lean Journey: From Post-War Japan to Global Manufacturing Leader',
  '[Your case study content from Phase 3]',
  '["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3", "Question 4", "Question 5"]'::jsonb,
  15
);

-- Repeat for all 5 case studies
```

**File: `insert-resources.sql`**
```sql
INSERT INTO resources (
  id,
  lesson_id,
  title,
  type,
  description,
  file_url,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '4-1',
  'DMAIC Project Charter Template',
  'template',
  'Excel template for documenting Six Sigma projects',
  '/templates/dmaic-project-charter.xlsx',
  NOW()
);

-- Repeat for all 10 templates
```

---

#### **Step 3: Execute SQL Scripts (2 hours)**

**Execution Order (respects foreign keys):**
1. Insert courses first
2. Insert lessons (references courses)
3. Insert quiz questions (references lessons)
4. Insert exercises (references lessons)
5. Insert case studies (references lessons)
6. Insert resources (references lessons)

**Execution Methods:**

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (SQL Editor)**
```
1. Navigate to Supabase Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to SQL Editor
4. Copy-paste each SQL file
5. Execute and verify results
6. Check for errors
```

**Option B: Command Line (psql)**
```bash
# Connect to Supabase database
psql "postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]"

# Execute each file
\i insert-courses.sql
\i insert-lessons.sql
\i insert-quiz-questions.sql
\i insert-exercises.sql
\i insert-case-studies.sql
\i insert-resources.sql

# Verify counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lessons;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quiz_questions;
```

**Option C: Supabase Client Library (TypeScript)**
```typescript
// Use for JSON imports (quiz questions)
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import quizQuestions from './quiz-questions/course-1-quizzes.json';

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);

// Batch insert quiz questions
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('quiz_questions')
  .insert(quizQuestions);

if (error) console.error('Error:', error);
else console.log('Inserted:', data);
```

---

#### **Step 4: Verify Data Integrity (1 hour)**

**Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] All 21 lessons inserted
- [ ] All 105 quiz questions inserted
- [ ] All 5 exercises inserted
- [ ] All 5 case studies inserted
- [ ] All 10 resources/templates inserted
- [ ] Foreign key relationships valid (no orphaned records)
- [ ] JSON fields properly formatted (options, discussion_questions)
- [ ] Text fields don't have encoding issues
- [ ] Order fields are sequential
- [ ] Timestamps are correct

**SQL Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses) as courses,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lessons) as lessons,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quiz_questions) as quiz_questions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises) as exercises,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM case_studies) as case_studies,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources) as resources;

-- Verify course-lesson relationships
SELECT c.title, COUNT(l.id) as lesson_count
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN lessons l ON c.id = l.course_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.title
ORDER BY c.order;

-- Verify lesson-quiz relationships
SELECT l.title, COUNT(q.id) as question_count
FROM lessons l
LEFT JOIN quiz_questions q ON l.id = q.lesson_id
GROUP BY l.id, l.title
ORDER BY l.order;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT 'Orphaned lessons' as issue, COUNT(*) as count
FROM lessons l
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM courses c WHERE c.id = l.course_id)
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Orphaned quiz questions', COUNT(*)
FROM quiz_questions q
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM lessons l WHERE l.id = q.lesson_id);
```

---

#### **Step 5: Test Data Retrieval (1 hour)**

**API Testing:**

**Test retrieving courses:**
```typescript
const { data: courses, error } = await supabase
  .from('courses')
  .select('*')
  .eq('belt_level', 'foundation')
  .order('order');

console.log('Courses:', courses);
```

**Test retrieving lessons with quiz questions:**
```typescript
const { data: lessons, error } = await supabase
  .from('lessons')
  .select(`
    *,
    quiz_questions (*),
    exercises (*),
    case_studies (*)
  `)
  .eq('course_id', '1')
  .order('order');

console.log('Course 1 Lessons:', lessons);
```

**Test quiz question format:**
```typescript
const { data: questions, error } = await supabase
  .from('quiz_questions')
  .select('*')
  .eq('lesson_id', '1-1');

// Verify JSON parsing
questions.forEach(q => {
  console.log('Options:', q.options); // Should be array
  console.log('Correct:', q.options[q.correct_answer]);
});
```
