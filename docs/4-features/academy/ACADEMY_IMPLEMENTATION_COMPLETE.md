   - `src/app/admin/academy/lessons/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (Line ~50: handleSave)

2. Example save function:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSaving(true);

  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('courses')
      .insert({
        title,
        description,
        short_description: shortDescription,
        learning_path_id: learningPathId,
        estimated_hours: parseFloat(estimatedHours),
        difficulty,
        instructor_name: instructor,
        is_published: isPublished,
        learning_objectives: objectives.filter(obj => obj.text.trim()).map(obj => obj.text)
      })
      .select()
      .single();

    if (error) throw error;
    
    router.push('/admin/academy/courses');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } finally {
    setIsSaving(false);
