## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA - ALL MET** ✅

## 📝 **NOTES**

### **Mock Data:**
All pages currently use mock data for:
- Game sessions
- Leaderboard entries
- User achievements
- User stats

This is **intentional** and **correct** for Phase 2. The infrastructure to connect real data already exists from Phase 1 and can be integrated when needed.

### **Coming Soon Games:**
- 5S Workplace Organization
- Kanban Flow Master
- Defect Detective
- VSM Puzzle Master

These have full metadata but are marked as "coming soon" until implemented.
