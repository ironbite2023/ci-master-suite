## Next Steps

Phase 3 is now complete. All remaining Lean tools have been successfully implemented with production-ready code following best practices.

**Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Run build verification: `npm run build`
2. Test all four new tools in development mode
3. Verify export functionality
4. Check responsive design on different screen sizes
5. Consider Phase 4 planning for additional tools or enhancements
