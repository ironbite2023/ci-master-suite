## üîç Finding Documentation

### By Folder Number (Reading Order)
1. **Architecture** ‚Üí Understand the system
2. **Planning** ‚Üí See what was planned
3. **Phases** ‚Üí Track implementation progress
4. **Features** ‚Üí Dive into specific features
5. **Technical** ‚Üí Technical deep-dives
6. **Guides** ‚Üí User-facing docs (future)

### By Feature
- **Academy**: `4-features/academy/`
- **Games**: `4-features/games/`
- **Guided Tools**: `4-features/guided-tools/`

### By Phase
- **Phase 2**: `3-phases/phase-2/`
- **Phase 3**: `3-phases/phase-3/`
- **Phase 4**: `3-phases/phase-4/`

## üìñ For New Team Members

**Recommended reading order:**
1. Start with `1-architecture/` to understand system design
2. Review `2-planning/` to understand project goals
3. Read `3-phases/` chronologically to see development journey
4. Dive into `4-features/` for the feature you'll work on
5. Reference `5-technical/` for technical implementation details

## üéØ Organization Principles

- **Numbered folders** create logical reading order
- **Feature-based** organization in `4-features/` 
- **Phase-based** organization in `3-phases/`
- **Subfolders** prevent overcrowding
- **README files** in each major folder for navigation

## ü§ñ For AI Agents & Documentation Creators

When creating new documentation files:
1. **Quick Reference:** `DOCUMENTATION_PLACEMENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (decision tree & examples)
2. **Complete Guide:** `1-architecture/plan-agent-instructions.md` (full placement rules)
3. **Structure Analysis:** `DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (why this structure exists)

**Key Rule:** Place feature-specific docs in `4-features/[feature]/`, phase docs in `3-phases/phase-X/`
