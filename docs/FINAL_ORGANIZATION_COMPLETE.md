## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### Documentation Patterns Identified:

1. **Catapult Naming:**
   - Week-based: `WEEK_X_COMPLETE.md`
   - Day-based: `WEEK_X_DAY_Y_COMPLETE.md`
   - Feature-based: `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

2. **Completion Reports:**
   - Progress: `_PROGRESS.md`
   - Complete: `_COMPLETE.md`
   - Summary: `_SUMMARY.md`

3. **Organization Principle:**
   - Feature-specific docs → `4-features/[feature]/`
   - Technical specs → `5-technical/[category]/`
   - Phase progress → `3-phases/phase-X/`

---

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Future Documentation:

1. **Catapult Game:**
   - Continue week/day pattern for progress docs
   - Place all in `docs/4-features/games/catapult/`
   - Consider creating week subfolders if exceeding 50 files

2. **New Games:**
   - Follow same pattern: `docs/4-features/games/[game-name]/`
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

3. **Technical Docs:**
   - Database schemas → `5-technical/database/`
   - Integration docs → `5-technical/` or feature folder
   - Fix summaries → `5-technical/`

4. **Never Place in Root:**
   - Implementation plans
   - Progress reports
   - Completion summaries
   - Database schemas
   - Technical specifications
