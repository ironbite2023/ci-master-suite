## üí° WRITING TIPS

### **For Course Descriptions:**
- Start with "By the end of this course, you will..."
- Include specific outcomes, not vague promises
- Mention tools/techniques they'll learn
- Keep it benefit-focused (not feature-focused)

### **For Learning Objectives:**
- Use action verbs (Apply, Analyze, Create, Evaluate)
- Be specific and measurable
- Follow Bloom's Taxonomy
- Example: "Calculate process capability indices (Cp and Cpk) from sample data"

### **For Quiz Questions:**
- Avoid trick questions
- Make all distractors plausible
- Explanations should teach, not just confirm
- Test understanding, not memorization
- Use real-world scenarios when possible

### **For Case Studies:**
- Use real companies when possible (with proper attribution)
- Include numbers/data
- Show before and after
- End with discussion questions that prompt critical thinking

### **For Templates:**
- Include instructions directly in the template
- Use dropdown menus where applicable (Excel)
- Include example data in a separate sheet/tab
- Make them professional and print-friendly

### **For Video Scripts:**
- Write conversationally (how you'd speak, not formal writing)
- Include [SHOW SLIDE X] or [SHOW EXAMPLE] cues
- Break into 2-3 minute chunks
- End each section with a mini-summary
- Include analogies and real-world examples
