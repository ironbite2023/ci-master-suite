## Context
- **File(s) Affected:** `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
- **User Action:** Clicking the AI Assistant in Five Whys tool and attempting to get coaching
- **Environment:** Development
- **API:** Anthropic Claude API
- **Component:** AIAssistant.tsx (frontend), route.ts (API)

## Root Cause Analysis
The application was using the model identifier `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, which was deprecated by Anthropic and reached its end-of-life on October 22, 2025. The Anthropic API no longer accepts requests to this model version, returning a 404 "not_found_error" instead.

According to Anthropic's official documentation, the current available models are:
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (latest high-performance model)
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (fastest)
- **Claude Opus 4**: `claude-opus-4-20250514` (most capable)

## Solution
Updated the model identifier in the API route to use the latest Claude Sonnet 4 model.

### Code Changes
```typescript
// File: src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts

// Before (Line 15-17)
// Call Claude - using the latest 3.5 Sonnet
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',

// After (Line 15-17)
// Call Claude - using Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
```

**Attempted Fix #1 (Failed):**
Initially attempted to use `claude-3-5-sonnet-20250219`, but this model identifier doesn't exist and also returned a 404 error.

**Final Fix (Successful):**
Updated to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` after consulting the official Anthropic documentation via Context7.

## Prevention
1. **Monitor Deprecation Notices:** Regularly check Anthropic's model deprecation announcements
2. **Use Latest Aliases:** Consider using model aliases like `claude-sonnet-latest` if available (verify with Anthropic docs)
3. **Documentation Reference:** Always verify current model names against official documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models
4. **Testing:** Test AI integrations regularly to catch deprecation issues early
5. **Error Monitoring:** Implement better error logging and alerting for API failures
