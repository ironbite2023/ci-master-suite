Feature implementation plan      → docs/4-features/[feature]/
Phase/sprint progress report     → docs/3-phases/phase-X/
Technical documentation          → docs/5-technical/[category]/
Architecture/system design       → docs/1-architecture/
Content planning/strategy        → docs/2-planning/
User guides/tutorials            → docs/6-guides/
```

**Default if unsure:** `docs/4-features/[most-relevant-feature]/`
